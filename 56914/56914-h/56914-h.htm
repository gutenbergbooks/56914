<h2 class="nobreak">FOREWORD</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Let</span> a child open the covers of this book, and
straightway he is in that land of all delights&mdash;Fairy
Realm. Here Fairy Godmothers reward
good children, and punish bad ones; here red-capped
Little Men yield up their treasures of gold
and magic gifts, while Pixies drop silver pennies
in water-pails, and merry Spriggans and Fays
hold nightly revels in the moonlight. Here, too,
a child may dance in Fairy Rings, or hie away
to Elfinland for a year and a day to play with
wonder-children, pick Fairy flowers, listen to
Fairy birds, and be fed on magic goodies.</p>

<p>Old favourites like &#8220;Cinderella,&#8221; &#8220;Toads and
Diamonds,&#8221; and &#8220;Robin Goodfellow,&#8221; may
charm the little reader, or other delightful tales,
new to most children, such as &#8220;Butterfly&#8217;s Diamond&#8221;
and &#8220;Timothy Tuttle and the Little
Imps,&#8221; will fascinate as much as do the older
tales. Stories are here from all lands where Fairies
thrive&mdash;Elfin-lore, legends, myths, and wonder-tales
from China, Japan, the South Seas,
England, Ireland, Wales, Cornwall, and Red
Indian land, and from many other Elfin-haunted
spots.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>And every story is about &#8220;Fairies black, grey,
green, and white,&#8221; and every one has been selected
for delightful humour, fancy, or ethical
teaching. Nearly all have been retold to meet
the needs of story-tellers and to please the children.
As far as possible the language of the
originals has been retained and elements that will
terrify little children or teach them that wrong
is right, have been eliminated. The French tales&mdash;all
but one&mdash;have been freshly translated.</p>

<p>A subject index is appended to aid the storyteller
in choosing stories dealing with specific
subjects, such as fruits, flowers, seasons, holidays,
trees, also with moral qualities like obedience,
thrift, honesty, and truth-telling.</p>

<p>To impart true Fairy spirit as well as literary
flavour, many famous Fairy poems by Shakespeare,
Ben Jonson, Michael Drayton, and other
poets are included; so that the volume forms a
collection of the best Fairy literature, not merely
planned to give the children joy, but to be of
real educational value.</p>

<p>&#8220;But of what possible educational value are
Fairy tales?&#8221; asks the practical parent or
teacher.</p>

<p>They are essential in the right development of
a child&#8217;s mind. They embody the poetic fancy of
the race. They stimulate a child&#8217;s imagination,
feed his fancy, and satisfy poetically his groping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
after things unseen. His craving for such tales
is due to a normal growth of mind. If he be deprived
of Fairy tales in childhood, he is likely, as
an adult, to lack the creative imagination which
makes big-visioned men and women, and leads
to success in literature, art, invention, or in the
practical things of business life. There are, of
course, children who do not like Fairy tales, but
they are few and far between, and other forms of
literature may be found which will, in part, help
to develop their peculiar type of mentality. But
Fairy tales are the heritage of the normal child,
and if he be judiciously fed on them, in later life
he will have a more plastic imagination and be
able to enjoy more fully the beauties of great
poetry and other fine literature.</p>

<p>Robert Burns said in a letter to Dr. Moore
that in his infant and boyish days he owed much
to an old woman who lived in his family; for
her tales of Brownies, and Fairies, and other wonders
&#8220;cultivated the latent seeds of poetry&#8221; in
the poet&#8217;s mind. And even the grave Luther
said, &#8220;I would not for any quantity of gold part
with the wonderful tales which I have retained
from my earliest childhood, or have met with in
my progress through life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Charles Lamb, and Coleridge too, believed
heartily in Fairy tales. &#8220;Ought children to be
permitted to read romances, and stories of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
Giants, Magicians, and Genii?&#8221; asked Coleridge.
&#8220;I know all that has been said against it; but I
have formed my faith in the affirmative. I know
no other way of giving the mind a love of the
Great and the Whole.... I read every book
that came in my way without distinction, and
my father was fond of me and used to take me
on his knee, and hold long conversations with
me. I remember when eight years old walking
with him one winter evening, ... and he then
told me the names of the stars, and how Jupiter
was a thousand times larger than our world, and
that the other twinkling stars were suns that had
worlds rolling round them; and when I came
home he showed me how they rolled round. I
heard him with a profound delight and admiration,
but without the least mixture of wonder or
incredulity. For from my early reading of Fairy
tales and about Genii, and the like, my mind
had been habituated to <i>the Vast</i>; and I never regarded
<i>my senses</i> in any way as the <i>criteria</i> of my
belief.&#8221;</p>

<p>Such, then, is the educational mission of the
Fairy tale, not only to give pure joy, but to enlarge
the mind. And as childhood is the only
time when this miracle takes place in its completeness,
every child who so desires should be
allowed to wander at will in the land of imaginative
delights, where the King of Fairy Poets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
Shakespeare, loved to wander as a child and as a
man. In &#8220;The Plea of the Midsummer Fairies&#8221;
that benign shape answers grisly Time who would
cut down &#8220;all the assembled Fays&#8221;:&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">COME! COME!<br />
TO THE FAIRIES&#8217; STORY HOUR!</h4></div>

<p class="center"><strong>IN THE MOONLIT MEADOW</strong></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Fairies!</span> Fairies everywhere! Hear them come!
See them come in the pale moonlight to this
lovely meadow! They rush through the air; they
throng from the wood; they spring up from the
ground; they peep from the flowers and leaves.
They are all hastening to the Fairies&#8217; Story Hour.
The Midsummer moon is shining, shining; while
the Midsummer breeze is swaying, swaying the
harebells, lilies, and grasses.</p>

<p>Laughter! whisper! Laughter! whisper! See,
through the air comes gliding a whole host of
radiant little Fairies. They poise lightly on their
silvery wings, and float down to the harebells
and lilies. They flicker over the meadow like
gay butterflies. Laughter! whisper!</p>

<p>Hum! whirr! Hum! whirr! What is that noise
in the tree-tops? From among the dark leaves
fly hundreds and hundreds of broad-backed beetles,
bumping and thumping each other. They are
followed by a silent cloud of bats, that wheel and
whirl, and flap their leathery wings. And to the
back of every beetle and every bat clings a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
tiny roguish Elf peeping down at the meadow
below.</p>

<p>Rap! tack! tack! Rap! tack! tack! From behind
each tree-trunk steps a little Leprechaun as
big as your thumb. They are the Fairy Shoemakers.
Their long beards and red caps wag in
the moonlight; and the little men smile and
chuckle to themselves, for well they know where
the pots of Fairy Gold are hidden. Near them,
peering from behind stones and bushes, are the
Curmudgeons, rolling their mischievous eyes.</p>

<p>Skip! skip! Knock! knock! What have we
here? From out of the earth pours a swarm of
little Spriggans and Pixies gaily dressed, and
Knockers with their tiny hammers in their tiny
hands. They have left the meadows and moors;
they have left the mines of tin and copper, and
the diamond caves, to come to the Fairies&#8217; Story
Hour. How they hustle, how they bustle, out of
the earth!</p>

<p>Gallop-a-trot! Gallop-a-trot! What comes from
the wood? A long line of prancing goats and
house-cats! And on the back of each is a House-Elf,
to be sure! The Brownies, the Boggarts, the
Tomts, the Piskeys, are all there. They have
left their snug corners in human homes; they
have left cellars, barns, and threshing-floors; they
have left bowls of clubbered cream on warm
hearthstones, to come to the Fairies&#8217; Story Hour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
And who is this that lights their way with a
Will-o&#8217;-the-Wisp lantern? &#8217;Tis Robin Goodfellow,
freakish Elf! Ho! Ho! Ho!</p>

<p>Sing! cling! Sing! cling! What are these that
come sailing through the air? Mother-of-pearl
boats with coral masts and sails of sea-lace! Each
little boat is crowded with Sea-Queens and Water-Fairies.
Their green hair is long and flowing, and
their robes are of rainbow spray. And near them,
astride frisky sea-horses, are the Kelpies, blowing
loudly on their conch-shell trumpets. And
each Kelpie is armed with a shield of pearl and a
sword-fish weapon. They have all left the foaming
green waves and the pink coral palaces to
come to the Fairies&#8217; Story Hour.</p>

<p>Now! Listen! Listen! The harebells and lilies
are ringing sweet music, while from meadow
flowers and acorn-cups and forest nuts tumble
lazy, sleepy Elves rubbing their eyes, and hastening
to join the others at the Fairies&#8217; Story Hour.</p>

<p>The harebells and lilies ring louder and louder.
And from out the cool wood step King Oberon
and Queen Mab, with all their Fairy train that
glitters in the moonshine like a long string of
jewels.</p>

<p>The royal train advances into the middle of
the meadow. The King and Queen seat themselves
on a throne of moss. At their left is capering
Puck mowing and mouthing; at their right,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
Ariel the sweetest singer. All present bow themselves
before the throne.</p>

<p>See! Queen Mab raises her wand, and each
little Elf and Fairy scurries and hurries to make
himself comfortable. Some sway on the blades
of grass; others climb the flower stalks and curl
up inside the fragrant blossoms; while still others
swing and rock in the trees, or nestle among the
ferns and under toadstool umbrellas.</p>

<p>Every wee Elf, and every tiny Fairy, and every
little Imp, from all the world over, is here. Indeed,
all the members of the entire Fairy Family
are present except the human-sized ones. They
are too busy to come. The Elfin Princes are
searching cottages and palaces for mortal brides
to carry off to Fairyland. The Elfin nurses are
leaving Changelings in babies&#8217; cradles; while the
Fairy Godmothers are far away bestowing wonderful
gifts on good children, and punishing bad
ones.</p>

<p>Look! Look! Queen Mab waves her wand!
The Fairies&#8217; Story Hour is beginning. All is
hushed.</p>

<p>Listen now to the Fairy tales.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">ADVENTURES OF ROBIN
GOODFELLOW</h4></div>

<p class="center"><i>From Merry England</i></p>


<h5>HOW ROBIN GOODFELLOW WAS BORN</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time, when men did eat more and
drink less, when men did know no knavery, there
were wont to walk many harmless sprites called
Fairies, dancing in brave order in Fairy Rings
on green hills, to sweet music. These sprites
would make themselves invisible, and many mad
pranks would they play, pinching careless housemaids
black and blue, and turning ill-kept houses
topsy-turvy. But lovingly they would use neat
housemaids, giving them silver and other pretty
toys which they left in the maids&#8217; shoes and
pockets, or in bright kitchen pans.</p>

<p>Now, in those Fairy days there was born on
earth a tiny Elfin boy whom folk called Robin
Goodfellow. And wonderful were the gifts from
Fairyland that came to Robin when he was a
baby. In his room suddenly would appear rich
embroidered cushions, delicate linen garments,
and all sorts of delicious things to eat and drink.
So he was never in want.</p>

<p>Now, when Robin was grown to six years, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
was so mischievous that the neighbours all complained
of his pranks until he was forced to run
away.</p>

<p>He wandered about until he began to get
hungry; then, going to a tailor, he took service
with him. He remained there until he grew so
mischievous that he was obliged to run away
again.</p>


<h5>HOW HE RECEIVED A MESSAGE FROM FAIRYLAND</h5>

<p>After he had travelled a good day&#8217;s journey
from the tailor&#8217;s house, he sat down by the wayside
and, being weary, fell asleep. No sooner had
he closed his eyes than he fancied he saw tiny
beings tripping on the grass before him, to the
sound of sweet music. And when he awoke, he
found, to his surprise, a scroll lying near by on
which were these verses, written in letters of
gold:&mdash;</p>



<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;<i>Robin, my only son and heir,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>For food and drink take thou no care.</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Wish what thou wilt, and thou shalt have</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>The power to tease both fool and knave.</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Change when thou wilt thine Elfish shape,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>To horse, or hog, or dog, or ape;</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>And scare each idle dirty maid,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>And make all wicked men afraid.</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>But love thou those that honest be,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>And help them in necessity.</i></div>
</div>
  <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;<i>Do thus, and all the world shall know</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></div>
<div class="verse"><i>The pranks of Robin Goodfellow.</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>If thou&#8217;lt observe my just command,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>One day thou shalt see Fairyland.</i>&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Robin, having read this, was very joyful, for
he perceived that he had Fairy power. He
straightway wished for something to eat, and it
appeared before him. Then he wished himself a
horse, and no sooner did he say so than he became
a handsome colt, curveting and leaping about.
He wished himself a dog, and was one. After
that he turned himself into any shape he liked.
Then taking his own form again, he once more
started on his travels.</p>


<h5>OF HIS MAD PRANKS&mdash;HO! HO! HO!</h5>

<p>And from that time forward many were the
merry tricks Robin played on those he met.</p>

<p>Once, seeing a rude and clownish fellow searching
for a lost horse, Robin turned himself into a
horse, and led the rude man a chase over field
and briar, until he allowed the man to catch him
and mount his back. Then Robin jumped into a
stream and, turning into a fish, swam to the shore
and ran away, laughing, &#8220;Ho! Ho! Ho!&#8221;&mdash;leaving
the man to get out of the water as best he could.</p>

<p>At night Robin often visited farmers&#8217; houses,
and helped the neat housemaids with their work,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
breaking their hemp, dressing their flax, and
spinning their yarn. One night he came to a
house where there was a good and handsome
maid. And while she slept Robin did her work,
more than she could have done in twelve hours.
The maid wondered the next morning to see all
done so finely, and that night she watched to
see what would follow.</p>

<p>At twelve of the clock in came Robin and, singing,
fell to work breaking her hemp and doing her
spinning, and as he worked he sang a mad song:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;<i>Within and out, in and out, round as a ball,</i></div>
<div class="indent"><i>With hither and thither, as straight as a line,</i></div>
<div class="indent"><i>With lily and germander, and sops of wine,</i></div>
<div class="indent5"><i>With sweetbriar,</i></div>
<div class="indent5"><i>And bonfire,</i></div>
<div class="indent5"><i>And strawberry wire,</i></div>
<div class="indent5"><i>And columbine!</i>&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>The maid, seeing that he had no clothes, pitied
him, and the next night she laid out a little suit
that she had cut and sewed during the day.
Robin, coming in, spied the clothes, whereat he
started, and said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;<i>&#8217;Tis not your garments new or old</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>That Robin loves. I feel no cold.</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Had you left me milk or cream,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>You should have had a pleasant dream,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Became you left no drop or crumb,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Robin never more will come.</i>&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>And with that he ran out of the door, laughing
loudly, &#8220;Ho! Ho! Ho!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>And many other mad pranks did Robin Goodfellow
play. At times he turned himself into a
will-o&#8217;-the-wisp, misleading lovers who came over
the heath; at other times he punished knaves and
idle maids, or rewarded good and worthy people.
And always he ran laughing, &#8220;Ho! Ho! Ho!&#8221;</p>


<h5>HOW HE DANCED IN THE FAIRY RING</h5>

<p>At length Oberon, King of Fairyland, seeing
so many honest and merry tricks, called one
night to Robin as he lay sleeping in the green-wood:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;<i>Robin, my son, come, quickly rise!</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>First stretch, then yawn, and rub your eyes.</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>For you must go with me to-night</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>To dance with Fairy, Elf, and Sprite.</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Come quickly now, my roguish son,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>&#8217;Tis time our sports were well begun.</i>&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Robin, hearing this, woke and rose hastily, and,
looking about, saw in the moonlight King Oberon,
and many Fairies with him dressed in green silk.
And all these did welcome Robin Goodfellow into
their company.</p>

<p>King Oberon took Robin by the hand and led
him a dance. And near by sat little Tom Thumb,
the Fairy piper, no bigger than a plum. His bagpipe
was made of a wren&#8217;s quill and the skin of
a tiny bug. This pipe made music so shrill and
sweet, that naught might be compared to it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>Then all the Fairies for joy did circle Robin
around, and in a ring did dance about him; and
Robin Goodfellow danced in the midst of them,
and sang this song:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
<div class="indent6">&#8220;<i>Quick and nimble!</i></div>
<div class="indent6"><i>Quick and nimble!</i></div>
<div class="indent6"><i>Round about little ones!</i></div>
<div class="indent6"><i>In and out, wheel about,</i></div>
<div class="indent6"><i>Run, hop, or amble!</i></div>
</div>
  <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;<i>Elves, Urchins, Goblins all, and little Fairies,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Who do pinch black and blue, idle maids in dairies,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Make a ring on the grass, with your quick measures.</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Tom shall play, and I will sing, for all your pleasures.</i></div>
</div>
  <div class="stanza">
<div class="indent6">&#8220;<i>Quick and nimble!</i></div>
<div class="indent6"><i>Quick and nimble!</i></div>
<div class="indent6"><i>Round about little ones!</i></div>
<div class="indent6"><i>In and out, wheel about,</i></div>
<div class="indent6"><i>Run, hop, or amble!</i>&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Thus they danced for a good space, then sat
themselves down upon the grass, and the Fairies
told Robin of many Elfish tricks and merry capers;
until, the time passing, a shepherd in a field
near by blew his pipes so loudly that he frightened
little Tom Thumb.</p>

<p>The Fairies punished the shepherd by the loss
of his pipes, so that they presently broke in his
hand, to his great amazement. Hereat Robin
Goodfellow laughed, &#8220;Ho! Ho! Ho!&#8221;</p>

<p>The morning being come, at cock-crow the
Fairies hastened away to Fairyland, where I
think they yet remain.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">THE POTATO SUPPER</h4></div>

<p class="center"><i>From Ireland</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> folk say that the Little People, the Fairies,
were once angels that were cast out of Heaven
for their sins. They fell to earth and grew smaller
and smaller. And to-day they dance on moonlit
nights in Fairy Rings, and play all manner of
pranks.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, one night a merry troop of
them was capering in the moonshine. On a nice
green sward by a river&#8217;s bank the little fellows
were dancing hand-in-hand, with their red caps
wagging at every bound. And so light were their
feet that the dew trembled, but was not disturbed.
So they danced, spinning around and
around, and twirling, and bobbing, and diving,
until one of them chirped:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;<i>Cease! Cease with your humming!</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Here&#8217;s an end to your mumming!</i></div>
<div class="indent4"><i>By my smell</i></div>
<div class="indent4"><i>I can tell</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>That a Priest is now coming!</i>&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>And away all the Fairies scampered as fast as
they could. Some hid under the green leaves of
the Foxglove, their little caps peeping out like
crimson bells. Others crept under the shadow
of stones, or beneath the bank of the river.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>And scarcely had they done so, when along
came Father Horrigan riding slowly on his pony.
He was thinking to himself that he would end his
journey at the first cabin he came to. And so he
did, for soon he stopped at the little house of
Dermod Leary, and, lifting the latch, walked in
with: &#8220;A blessing on all here!&#8221;</p>

<p>And a welcome guest, you may be sure, was
Father Horrigan, for no man was better loved
in all that country. But when Dermod saw him
enter, he was troubled, for he had nothing to offer
for supper except some potatoes that his wife
was boiling in a pot over the fire. Then he remembered
that he had set a net in the river.
&#8220;There&#8217;ll be no harm,&#8221; thought he, &#8220;in my stepping
down to see if anything has been caught.&#8221;</p>

<p>So down to the river went Dermod. He found
as fine a salmon in the net as ever jumped from
water. But as he was taking it out, the net was
jerked from his hands, and away the salmon went,
swimming along as though nothing had happened.</p>

<p>Dermod looked sorrowfully at the wake that
the fish left shining like a line of silver in the
moonlight.</p>

<p>&#8220;May bitter luck attend you night and day!&#8221;
cried he, shaking his fist. &#8220;Some evil thing sure
it was that helped you, for did I not feel it pull
the net out of my hand!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re all wrong, Dermod! There were a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
hundred or more of us pulling against you!&#8221;
squeaked a little voice near his feet, and the whole
troop of Fairies&mdash;hundreds and hundreds of
them&mdash;came rushing from their hiding-places,
and stood before him, their red caps nodding
violently.</p>

<p>Dermod gazed at them in wonder; then one of
the Fairies said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Make yourself noways uneasy about the
Priest&#8217;s supper, Dermod Leary. If you will go
back and ask him one question for us, there&#8217;ll be
as fine a supper spread before him in no time, as
ever was put on table.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have nothing to do with you at all, at
all!&#8221; answered Dermod; &#8220;I know better than to
sell my soul to the likes of you!&#8221;</p>

<p>But the little Fairy was not to be repulsed.
&#8220;Will you ask the Priest just one civil question
for us, Dermod?&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>Dermod considered for a moment. &#8220;I see no
objection,&#8221; said he, &#8220;to the same. But I&#8217;ll have
nothing to do with your supper, mind that!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Little People all crowded near him, while
the Fairy answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go and ask Father Horrigan to tell us whether
our souls will be saved at the Last Day. And, if
you wish us well, Dermod Leary, you will bring
the word that he says.&#8221;</p>

<p>Away went Dermod to his cabin.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>&#8220;Please, your reverence,&#8221; said he to Father
Horrigan, &#8220;may I make bold to ask your honour
a question?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; said Father Horrigan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, then,&#8221; said Dermod, &#8220;will the souls of
the Little People be saved at the Last Day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who bids you ask that question, Leary?&#8221;
said Father Horrigan, fixing his eyes sternly on
Dermod.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell no lies about the matter, nothing in
life but the truth,&#8221; answered Dermod. &#8220;&#8217;Twas
the Little People themselves who sent me. They
are in thousands down on the bank of the river
waiting for your word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go back,&#8221; said Father Horrigan, &#8220;and tell
them that if they want to know they must come
here to me themselves, and I&#8217;ll answer that and
any other question.&#8221;</p>

<p>So back Dermod hurried to the river. The
Fairies came swarming around him. They pressed
close to his feet, with faces upturned as they
anxiously waited. And Dermod, brave man that
he was, spoke out boldly and gave them the
Priest&#8217;s message. And when they heard that, the
whole multitude of little Fairies uttered shrill
cries and groans; and they whisked past Dermod
in such numbers that he was quite bewildered.
Then in a trice he found himself alone.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_018f.jpg" alt="DERMOD GAZED AT THEM IN WONDER" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;DERMOD GAZED AT THEM IN WONDER&#8221;</p>

<p>He went slowly back to his cabin. He opened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>the door. The fire was burning brightly. The
candles were lighted. And good Father Horrigan
was seated comfortably at the table, a pitcher
of new milk before him, and a bit of fresh butter,
from Dermod&#8217;s cow. And Dermod&#8217;s wife was
handing him a big, handsome potato, whose white,
mealy insides were bursting through its skin, and
smoking like a hard-ridden horse on a frosty
night.</p>

<p>Dermod sat down at the table, and began to
eat without a word. And when Father Horrigan
was through the good Priest smacked his lips,
and said that he had relished the hot tasty potatoes,
more than a dozen fat salmon, and a whole
Fairy feast!</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">THE MILK-WHITE CALF AND THE<br />
FAIRY RING</h4></div>

<p class="center"><i>From Ireland</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> Tipperary is one of the most singularly shaped
hills in the world. It has a peak at the top like a
conical nightcap. On this very peak, long years
ago, a herdsman spent his nights and days watching
the herd. Now, the hill was ancient Fairy
ground, and the Little People were angry that
the scene of their light and airy gambols should
be trampled by the rude hoofs of bulls and cows.
The lowing of the cattle sounded sad in their
ears. So the Queen of the Fairies determined to
drive away the herdsman.</p>

<p>One night the moon shone brightly on the hill.
The cattle were lying down. The herdsman,
wrapped in his mantle, was watching the twinkling
stars, when suddenly there appeared before
him a great horse with the wings of an eagle, and
the tail of a dragon. This beast hissed loudly and
spat fire, and, while the herdsman was looking on,
half dead with fright, it turned into a little old
man, lame of leg, with a bull&#8217;s head around which
flames were playing.</p>

<p>The next moment the little old man changed
into a huge ape, with duck&#8217;s feet, and a turkey-cock&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
tail. And then the Queen of the Fairies&mdash;for
of course it was she&mdash;roared, neighed, hissed,
bellowed, howled, and hooted so fearfully that
the poor herdsman in terror covered his head
with his mantle. But it was of no use, for with
one puff of wind she blew away the fold of his
mantle, let him hold it never so tightly. As for
the poor man, he could not stir or close his eyes,
but was forced to sit there gazing at this terrible
sight until his hair lifted his hat half a foot from
his head, and his teeth chattered so that they
almost fell out of his mouth.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the frightened cattle scampered
about like mad, as if bitten by fleas, and so they
continued to do until the sun rose. Then the
Fairy Queen disappeared.</p>

<p>Night after night, the same thing happened,
and the cattle went mad. Some fell into pits, or
tumbled into the river and were drowned. By
and by, not a herdsman was willing to tend the
cattle at night. The farmer who owned the hill
offered triple and quadruple wages, but not a
man was found who would face the terrors of the
Fairy Ring. The herd gradually thinned, and
the Fairies, on moonlit nights, danced and gambolled
as merrily as before, sipping dew-drops from
acorn-cups, and spreading their feasts on the
heads of mushrooms.</p>

<p>Now, there dwelt in that part of the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
a man named Larry Hoolahan, who played on
the pipes better than any other player within
fifteen parishes. A dashing, roving blade was
Larry, and afraid of nothing. One day the
farmer met him, and told him all his misfortunes.</p>

<p>&#8220;If that is what ails you,&#8221; said Larry, &#8220;make
your mind easy. Were there as many Fairies on
the hill as there are potato-blossoms in Tipperary,
I would face them. It would be a queer thing,
indeed, if I, who was never afraid of a proper man,
should turn my back on a Fairy not the bigness
of one&#8217;s thumb!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Larry,&#8221; said the farmer, &#8220;do not talk so bold,
for you know not who is hearing you! But, if
you make your words good, and watch my herds
for a week on top of the hill, your hand shall be
free of my dish till the sun has burnt itself down
to the bigness of a farthing rushlight!&#8221;</p>

<p>The bargain was struck, and Larry went to the
hill-top when the moon was beginning to peep
over its brow. He took his seat on a big stone
under a hollow of the hill, with his back to the
wind, and pulled out his pipes.</p>

<p>He had not played long when the voices of the
Fairies were heard upon the blast like a low stream
of music. Presently they burst into a loud laugh,
and Larry could plainly hear one say:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;What! Another man upon the Fairies&#8217; Ring!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Go to him, Queen, and make him repent of his
rashness!&#8221;</p>

<p>And away they flew, and Larry felt them pass
by his face like a swarm of midges. Looking up
hastily he saw, between the moon and him, a great
black cat, standing on the very tip of its claws,
with its back up, and mewing with a voice like
a water-mill.</p>

<p>Presently it swelled up toward the sky, and,
turning round on its left hind leg, whirled till it
fell to the ground. Then it started up in the
shape of a salmon with a cravat round its neck,
and wearing a pair of new top-boots.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on, my jewel!&#8221; said Larry. &#8220;If you dance,
I&#8217;ll pipe,&#8221; and he struck up.</p>

<p>But the Queen of the Fairies&mdash;for of course
it was she&mdash;turned into this and that and the
other; but still Larry played on, as well as he
knew how. At last she lost patience, and changed
herself into a calf, milk-white as the cream of
Cork, and with eyes as mild as those of a loving
girl.</p>

<p>She came up gentle and fawning, hoping to
throw him off his guard, and then to work him
some wrong. But Larry was not so deceived, for
when she came near, dropping his pipes, he leaped
on her back.</p>

<p>Now, from the top of the hill, as you look westward,
you may see the broad river Shannon, full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
ten miles away. On this night its waters shone
beautifully under the moon, and no sooner had
Larry leaped on the back of the Fairy Queen
than she sprang from the hill-top, and bounded
clear at one jump, over the Shannon. It was
done in a second; and, when she alighted on the
distant bank, she kicked up her heels, and flung
Larry on the soft turf.</p>

<p>No sooner was Larry thus planted than he
looked her straight in the face, and cried out:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;By my word, well done! That was not a bad
leap, <i>for a calf</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>She gazed at him for a moment, and then,
assuming her own shape, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Larry Hoolahan, you are a bold fellow! Will
you go back the way you came?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s what I will!&#8221; said he, &#8220;if you&#8217;ll
let me!&#8221;</p>

<p>So she changed to a calf again, and Larry got
on her back. At another bound they were standing
inside the Fairy Ring.</p>

<p>Then the Queen, once more assuming her own
shape, addressed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have shown so much courage, Larry
Hoolahan,&#8221; said she, &#8220;that while you keep herds
on this hill, you shall not be molested by me or
mine. The day dawns. Go down to the farmer,
and tell him this. And, if anything I can do will
be of service to you, ask and you shall have it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>She vanished accordingly, and kept her word
in never visiting the hill during Larry&#8217;s lifetime;
but he never troubled her with requests. He
piped, and ate and drank at the farmer&#8217;s expense,
and roosted in the chimney-corner, occasionally
casting an eye on the herd. He died at last; and
is buried in a green valley of pleasant Tipperary.
But whether the Fairies returned to the hill after
his death is more than I can say.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">THE WOOD-LADY</h4></div>

<p class="center"><i>From Bohemia</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time there was a little girl named
Betty. Her mother was a widow and very poor,
and owned only a tumble-down house and two
goats. Nevertheless, Betty was always cheerful.
From Spring to Autumn she pastured the goats
in the birch wood. Every morning when she left
home, her mother gave her a little basket in
which were a slice of bread and a spindle.</p>

<p>&#8220;My child,&#8221; she said, &#8220;work hard to-day and
fill the spindle before you return.&#8221;</p>

<p>And, as Betty had no distaff, she wound the
flax around her head, took the basket, and, with
a skip and a jump, led her goats to the birch wood.
There she sat under a tree and drew fibres of the
flax from her head with her left hand, and let
down the spindle with her right, so that it just
hummed over the ground. And all the while she
sang merrily, and the goats nibbled the green
grass.</p>

<p>When the sun showed that it was midday she
put aside her work, called her goats, and, after
giving them each a morsel of bread, bounded
into the wood to look for strawberries. When she
came back she ate her fruit and bread, and, folding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
her hands, danced and sang. The goats, enjoying
themselves among the green grass, thought:
&#8220;What a merry shepherdess we have!&#8221; After
her dance, she spun again. And at evening she
drove her goats home, and her mother never had
to scold her for bringing the spindle back empty.</p>

<p>One lovely Spring day, just as Betty sprang up
to dance, suddenly&mdash;where she came, there she
came!&mdash;a beautiful maiden stood before her.
She wore a white dress as thin as gossamer, golden
hair flowed to her waist, and on her head was a
garland of wood flowers. Betty was struck dumb
with astonishment.</p>

<p>The maiden smiled at her, and said in a very
sweet voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Betty, are you fond of dancing?&#8221;</p>

<p>When the maiden spoke so prettily, Betty&#8217;s
terror quitted her, and she answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I should like to dance all day!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, then, let us dance together. I will
teach you,&#8221; said the maiden.</p>

<p>And she took Betty by the waist, and began
to dance with her.</p>

<p>As they circled, such delicious music sounded
over their heads that Betty&#8217;s heart skipped within
her. The musicians sat on branches of the birches.
They were clad in black, ash-coloured, and variegated
coats. They were choice musicians who
had come together at the call of the beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
maiden&mdash;nightingales, larks, linnets, goldfinches,
thrushes, blackbirds, and a very skillful
mocking-bird. Betty&#8217;s cheeks flamed, her eyes
glittered, she forgot her task and her goats. She
could only gaze at her partner, who whirled her
around with the most charming movements, and
so lightly that the grass did not bend beneath
her delicate weight.</p>

<p>They danced from noon till eve, and Betty&#8217;s
feet were neither weary nor sore. Then the beautiful
maiden stopped, the music ceased, and as
she came, so she went, and she vanished as if the
earth had swallowed her.</p>

<p>Betty looked about. The sun had set. She
clapped her hands to the top of her head, and
remembered that her spindle was by no means
full. She took the flax and put it with the spindle
into her basket, and drove the goats home. That
night her mother did not ask to see her work.</p>

<p>Next morning Betty again drove the goats to
pasture. All happened as before. Where she
came, there she came!&mdash;and the beautiful
maiden seized Betty by the waist, and they
danced from noon till eve.</p>

<p>Then Betty saw that the sun was setting and
her spindle nearly empty, so she began to cry.
But the maiden put her hands to Betty&#8217;s head,
took off the flax, and twined it round the stem of
a slender birch, and began to spin. The spindle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
just swung over the ground. It grew fuller and
fuller, and before the sun set behind the wood,
all the yarn was spun. Giving the full spindle
into Betty&#8217;s hands, the maiden said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;<i>Reel and grumble not!</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Reel and grumble not!</i>&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>And as she came, so she went, and she vanished
as if the ground had swallowed her. Betty
drove the goats home, and gave her mother the
full spindle.</p>

<p>Well, the next day all happened as before.
Where she came, there she came!&mdash;and the
beautiful maiden seized Betty by the waist, and
they danced from noon to eve. Then the maiden
handed Betty a covered basket, saying:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;<i>Peep not, but go home!</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Peep not, but go home!</i>&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>And as she came, so she went, and she vanished
as if the ground had swallowed her.</p>

<p>At first Betty was afraid to peep into the basket,
but when she was halfway home, she could
not restrain herself. She lifted the cover and
peeped, and, oh! how disappointed she was when
she saw that the basket was full of birch leaves!
She began to cry, and threw out two handfuls
of the leaves, and was going to shake them all
out of the basket, but she thought to herself:
&#8220;They&#8217;ll make good litter for the goats.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>When she reached home her mother was waiting
for her at the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;What sort of a spindle did you bring home to
me yesterday?&#8221; cried she. &#8220;After you left this
morning I began to reel. I reeled and I reeled,
and the spindle remained full. One skein! two
skeins! three skeins! and the spindle was yet full!
&#8216;What evil spirit has spun you?&#8217; grumbled I;
and at that instant the yarn vanished from the
spindle. Tell me the meaning of this.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Betty confessed how she had danced with
the beautiful maiden who had given her the full
spindle, and who had said: &#8220;Reel and grumble
not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was a Wood-Fairy!&#8221; cried her mother
in astonishment. &#8220;About noon in the Spring-time,
the Wood-Ladies dance. Lucky for you
that she did not tickle you to death! It&#8217;s a pity
that you did not tell me before, for I might have
had a room full of yarn, if I had reeled and grumbled
not.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Betty bethought herself of the basket of
leaves. She lifted the cover and peeped in again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look! Look! Mother!&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>Her mother looked and clapped her hands. The
birch leaves were turned to gold!</p>

<p>&#8220;She told me not to peep until I reached
home,&#8221; said Betty, &#8220;but I disobeyed and threw
two handfuls of the leaves away.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>&#8220;Lucky for you that you did not throw them
all away!&#8221; exclaimed her mother.</p>

<p>The next morning they both went to the place
where Betty had thrown out the leaves, but on
the road lay nothing but birch leaves. However,
the gold Betty had brought home was enough
to make them rich. Her mother bought a fine
house and garden. They had many cattle. Betty
had handsome clothes, and she did not need
to pasture the goats any more. But though she
had everything she desired, nothing gave her so
great delight as the dance with the Wood-Fairy.
She often went to the birch wood hoping to
see the beautiful maiden, but she never again
set eyes upon her.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">MONDAY! TUESDAY!</h4></div>

<p class="center"><i>From Ireland</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> once lived a lad in old Ireland named Lusmore.
He had a great hump on his back, and
whenever he sat down he had to rest his chin on
his knee for support. But, in spite of this, he
was as happy as a cricket, and used to go about the
country with a sprig of Fairy-cap, or Foxglove, in
his little straw hat. He went from house to house
plaiting baskets out of rushes, and in that way he
earned a living. And he was so merry that people
always gave him a penny more than he asked.</p>

<p>One evening, he was returning from a distant
town, and as he walked slowly on account of his
hump, it grew dark before he could reach home.
He came to an old mound by the side of the road,
and, being tired, sat down on it to rest.</p>

<p>He had not been sitting there long when he
heard strains of music, and many little voices
singing sweetly. He laid his ear to the mound, and
perceived that the music and singing came from
inside it. And he could hear the words that the
little voices were chanting over and over again:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;<i>Monday! Tuesday!</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Monday! Tuesday!</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Monday! Tuesday!</i>&#8221;</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>It was all so very sweet, that Lusmore listened
with delight; but by and by he grew tired of hearing
the same words sung over and over. He
waited politely until the voices had finished their
song, then he called:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;<i>And Wednesday!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>The Fairies&mdash;for it was the singing of Fairies
that he heard&mdash;were so pleased with Lusmore&#8217;s
addition to their words, that they pulled him
right down through the top of the mound with
the speed of a whirlwind. And he went falling and
twirling round and round as light as a feather.</p>

<p>He found himself in a palace so bright that it
dazzled his eyes. Then all the Fairies stopped
capering and dancing, and came crowding around
him. And one, wearing a crown, stepped forward
and said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;<i>Lusmore! Lusmore!</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>The hump that you wore,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>On your back is no more.</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Look down on the floor,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>And see it, Lusmore!</i>&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>And as these words were being said, Lusmore
felt himself grow so light and happy, that he
could have bounded up to the moon. And he saw
his hump tumble off his back and roll on the floor.
Then the Fairies took hands, and danced around
him, and as they did so he became dizzy and fell
asleep.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>When he opened his eyes it was broad daylight,
and the sun was shining, and the birds were singing,
and cows and sheep were grazing peacefully
around him. He put his hand to his hump. It
was gone! And there he was, as tall, straight, and
handsome as any other lad in Ireland. And, besides
all that, he was dressed in a full suit of beautiful
clothes.</p>

<p>He went toward his home stepping out lightly,
and jumping high at every step, so full of joy was
he. And as he passed his neighbours, they hardly
knew him without his hump, and because he was
so straight and handsome, and was dressed so
finely.</p>

<p>Now, in another village, not far away, lived a
lad named Jack Madden. He also had a great
hump on his back. He was a peevish, cunning
creature, and liked to scratch and pinch all who
came near him.</p>

<p>When he heard how the Fairies had taken away
Lusmore&#8217;s hump, he decided that he, too, would
visit them. So one night after darkness had
fallen, he sat down on the mound all alone, and
waited. He had not been there long before he
heard the music, and the sweet voices singing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;<i>Monday! Tuesday!</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Monday! Tuesday!</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Monday! Tuesday!</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>And Wednesday!</i>&#8221;</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>And as he was in a very great hurry to get rid
of his hump, he did not wait for the Fairies to
finish their song, but yelled out, thinking that
two days were better than one:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;<i>And Thursday and Friday!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>No sooner had the words left his lips, than he
was taken up quickly, and whisked through the
mound with terrific force. And the Fairies came
crowding around him, screeching and buzzing
with anger, and crying out:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;<i>Our song you have spoiled!</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Our song you have spoiled!</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Our song you have spoiled!</i>&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Then the one wearing the crown stepped forward,
and said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;<i>Jack Madden! Jack Madden!</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Your words came so bad in,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>That your life we will sadden!</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Here&#8217;s two humps for Jack Madden!</i>&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>And quick as a wink, twenty Fairies brought
Lusmore&#8217;s hump and clapped it down on Jack
Madden&#8217;s back, and there it was fixed as firmly
as if nailed on with tenpenny nails.</p>

<p>Then out of the mound they kicked him. And
when morning was come, he crept home with the
two humps on his back&mdash;and he is wearing them
still.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">THE GREEDY OLD MAN</h4></div>

<p class="center"><i>From Cornwall</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Long</span> ago in Cornwall, on a hillock called &#8220;the
Gump,&#8221; there was a Fairy Ring. Many a good
old man or woman, on moonlit nights, had seen
the Fairies dancing there at their revels, and had
been rewarded with gifts small but rich.</p>

<p>Now, there was one greedy old man, who, having
heard his neighbours tell of the Fairy Gold at
the revels, decided to steal some of the treasure.
So on a moonlit night, when all was quiet, he
stole softly up to &#8220;the Gump.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he drew near he heard delightful music,
which seemed to come from inside the hillock.
The notes were now slow and solemn, and now
quick and gay, so that the old man had to weep
and laugh in one breath. Then before he knew
it, he began to dance to the Fairy measure. He
was forced by some unseen power to whirl round
and round; but in spite of this he kept his wits
about him, and watched to see what would happen.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a crashing sound, and a
door in the hillock opened. Instantly the old man
saw that everything about him was ablaze with
coloured lights. Each blade of grass was hung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
with tiny bright lamps, and every tree and bush
was illuminated with stars.</p>

<p>Out of the opening in the hillock marched a
band of Goblins, as if to clear the way. Then
came a number of Fairy musicians playing on
every kind of musical instrument. These were
followed by troop after troop of Elfin soldiers,
carrying waving banners.</p>

<p>The soldiers arranged themselves in two files
on either side of the door; but the Goblins, much
to the old man&#8217;s disgust, placed themselves close
behind him. As they were no bigger than his
thumb, he thought to himself: &#8220;If they bother
me, I can easily step on them and crush them
with my foot.&#8221;</p>

<p>This vast array having disposed itself, next
from the hillock came a crowd of Elfin servants
carrying pitchers of silver and gold, and goblets
cut out of diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and other
precious stones. Servants followed bearing aloft
gold and silver platters heaped high with the richest
meats, pastries, candies, and glowing fruits.
A number of Elfin boys, clad in crimson, then set
out small tables made of ivory curiously carved,
and the servants arranged the feast with order.</p>

<p>Then out of the hillock came crowding thousands
and thousands of lovely winged Fairies
clad in gossamer robes of every colour, like the
rainbow.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>The music suddenly changed to low, delicate
notes, and the old man found that he was no
longer forced to dance and whirl about. And as
he stood still, the perfume of a thousand rich
flowers filled the air, and the whole vast host of
Fairies began to sing a song as clear and sweet as
the tinkle of silver bells.</p>

<p>Then from the hillock issued forth line after
line of Elfin boys dressed in green and gold, and
behind them on an ivory throne, borne aloft by
a hundred Fairies, came the King and Queen of
Fairyland blazing with beauty and jewels.</p>

<p>The throne was placed upon the hillock, which
immediately bloomed with lilies and roses. Before
the King and Queen was set the most beautiful
of all the little tables laden with gold and
silver dishes and precious goblets. The Fairies
took their places at the other tables, and began
to feast with a will.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; thought the old man, &#8220;my time is
come! If only I can creep up, without being seen,
to the Fairy King&#8217;s table, I shall be able to snatch
enough gold to make me rich for life.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with his greedy mind set on this, he
crouched down, and began very slowly to creep
toward the throne. But he did not see that thousands
of Goblins had cast fine threads about his
body, and were holding the ends in their hands.</p>

<p>Trembling with greed, the old man crept closer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
and closer to the Fairy King and Queen. He took
his hat from his head, and raised it carefully to
cover the royal throne and table; and, as he
did so, he heard a shrill whistle. Instantly his
hand was fixed powerless in the air. Then, with a
sudden crash, all became dark around him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whirr! Whirr! Whirr!&#8221; and he heard as if a
flight of bees were brushing past his ears, and
suddenly, his body, from head to foot, was
stabbed with pins and pinched with tweezers.
Then he was thrown violently upon his back with
his arms outstretched; and his arms and legs were
fastened to the ground with magic chains. His
tongue seemed tied with cords so that he could
not call out.</p>

<p>And as he lay there trembling with fright and
pain, he felt as though swarms of insects were
running over him. Then he saw standing on his
nose a grinning Goblin. This little monster
stamped and jumped with great delight; then
making a fearful grimace, shouted:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;<i>Away! Away!</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>I smell the day!</i>&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>And on this, an army of Goblins, Fairies, and
Elves, who were running up and down the old
man&#8217;s body, stabbing him with pins, and pinching
him with tweezers, jumped quickly down, and
rushed into the hillock; which closed immediately.
And the old man saw the Fairies no more.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>At length the sun rose and he found that he
was tied to the ground with a myriad of gossamer
webs, which were covered with dew-drops
that glistened like diamonds in the sunlight.</p>

<p>He shook himself free, and got up. Wet, cold,
ashamed, and pinched black and blue, he returned
to his home. And you may be sure that
he never again tried to steal the Fairy Gold.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">LEGEND OF BOTTLE HILL</h4></div>

<p class="center"><i>From Ireland</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was in the good days, when the Little People
were more frequently seen than they are in these
unbelieving times, that a farmer, named Mick
Purcell, rented a few acres of barren ground not
far from the city of Cork.</p>

<p>Mick had a wife and seven children. They did
all that they could to get on, which was very
little, for the poor man had no child grown big
enough to help him in his work; and all that the
poor woman could do was to mind the children,
milk the cow, boil the potatoes, and carry the
eggs to market. So besides the difficulty of getting
enough to eat, it was hard on them to pay
the rent.</p>

<p>Well, they did manage to get along for a good
while; but at last came a bad year, and the little
field of oats was spoiled, and the chickens died
of the pip, and the pig got the measles, and poor
Mick found that he hadn&#8217;t enough to pay half
his rent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, then, Molly,&#8221; said he, &#8220;what&#8217;ll we
do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wisha, then, mavourneen, what would you
do but take the cow to the Fair of Cork, and sell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
her?&#8221; said she. &#8220;And Monday is Fair-day, so
you must go to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what&#8217;ll we do when she&#8217;s gone?&#8221; said
Mick.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never a know I know, Mick, but sure God
won&#8217;t leave us without help. And you know how
good He was to us when little Billy was sick, and
we had nothing at all for him to take&mdash;that good
doctor gentleman came riding past and asked
for a drink of milk, and he gave us two shillings,
and sent me things and a bottle for the child; and
he came to see Billy and never left off his goodness
until he was well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you are always hopeful, Molly, and I believe
you are right, after all,&#8221; Mick said, &#8220;so I
won&#8217;t be sorry for selling the cow. I&#8217;ll go to-morrow,
and you must put a needle and thread
through my coat, for you know it&#8217;s ripped under
the arm.&#8221;</p>

<p>Molly told him he should have everything
right. And about twelve o&#8217;clock the next day
he left her, after having promised not to sell his
cow except for the highest penny.</p>

<p>He drove the beast slowly through a little
stream that crossed the road under the walls of
an old fort; and as he passed, he glanced his eyes
on a pile of stones and an old elder tree that
stood up sharply against the sky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, then, if only I had half the Fairy money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
that is buried in yon fort, &#8217;tisn&#8217;t driving this
cow I&#8217;d be now!&#8221; said he aloud.</p>

<p>Then he moved on after his beast. &#8217;Twas a
fine day, and the sun shone brightly, and after
he had gone six miles, he came to that hill&mdash;Bottle
Hill it is called now, but that was not the
name of it then.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morrow, Mick!&#8221; said a little voice,
and with that a little man started up out of the
hill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morrow, kindly,&#8221; said Mick, and he
looked at the stranger who was like a dwarf with
a bit of an old wrinkled face, for all the world
like a dried cauliflower; only he had a sharp red
nose, red eyes, and white hair. His eyes were
never quiet, but looked at everything; and it
made Mick&#8217;s blood run cold just to see them roll
so rapidly from side to side.</p>

<p>In truth Mick did not like the little man&#8217;s company
at all, and he drove his cow somewhat
faster; but the little man kept up with him. Out
of the corner of his eye Mick could see that he
moved over the road without lifting one foot
after the other; and the poor fellow&#8217;s heart
trembled within him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going with that cow, honest
man?&#8221; said the little man at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;To the Fair of Cork, then,&#8221; said Mick, trembling
even more at the shrill and piercing voice.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>&#8220;Are you going to sell her?&#8221; asked the little
man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, then, what else am I going for, but to
sell her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you sell her to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mick started. He was afraid to have anything
to do with the little man, but he was more afraid
to say no.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what, I&#8217;ll give you this bottle,&#8221;
said the little man, pulling a bottle from under
his coat.</p>

<p>Mick looked at him and the bottle, and in spite
of his terror he could not help bursting into a
loud fit of laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Laugh if you will!&#8221; said the little man, &#8220;but
I tell you that this bottle is better for you than
all the money you will get for the cow at Cork&mdash;aye,
than ten thousand times as much.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mick laughed again. &#8220;Why, then,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;do you think I am such a fool as to give my good
cow for a bottle&mdash;and an empty one, too! Indeed,
then, I won&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better give me the cow, and take the
bottle&mdash;you&#8217;ll not be sorry for it,&#8221; said the little
man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, then, what would Molly say? I&#8217;d never
hear the last of it! And how should I pay the
rent? And what should we do without a penny
of money?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>&#8220;When you go home, never mind if your wife
is angry,&#8221; answered the little man, &#8220;but quiet
yourself, and make her sweep the room, and set
the table in the middle of the floor, and spread
the best cover on it. Then put the bottle on the
ground, saying these words: &#8216;Bottle, do your
duty!&#8217; And you will see the end of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And is this all?&#8221; said Mick.</p>

<p>&#8220;No more,&#8221; said the stranger, forcing the bottle
into Mick&#8217;s hand. Then he moved swiftly off
after the cow.</p>

<p>Well, Mick, rather sick at heart, retraced his
steps toward his cabin, and as he went he could
not help turning his head to look after the little
man; but he had vanished completely.</p>

<p>&#8220;He can&#8217;t belong to this earth,&#8221; exclaimed
Mick in horror to himself. &#8220;But where is the
cow?&#8221; She, too, was gone; and Mick hurried
homeward muttering prayers and holding fast
the bottle.</p>

<p>He soon reached his cabin, and surprised his
wife sitting over the turf fire in the big chimney.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Mick, are you come back?&#8221; said she.
&#8220;Sure you weren&#8217;t at Cork all the way? What
has happened to you? Where is the cow? Did
you sell her? How much money did you get for
her? What news have you? Tell us everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, then, Molly, if you&#8217;ll give me time, I&#8217;ll
tell you all about it!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>&#8220;Oh! then, you sold her. Where&#8217;s the money?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Arrah! stop a while, Molly, and I&#8217;ll tell you
all about it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what is that bottle under your waistcoat?&#8221;
said Molly, seeing its neck sticking out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, then, be easy about it,&#8221; said Mick, &#8220;till
I tell it you.&#8221; And putting the bottle on the table,
he added, &#8220;That&#8217;s all I got for the cow.&#8221;</p>

<p>His poor wife was thunderstruck. She sat crying,
while Mick told her his story, with many a
crossing and blessing between him and harm. She
could not help believing him, for she had great
faith in Fairies. So she got up, and, without saying
a word, began to sweep the earthen floor with
a bunch of heather. Then she tidied everything,
and put the long table in the middle of the room,
and spread over it a clean cloth.</p>

<p>And then Mick, placing the bottle on the
ground, said: &#8220;Bottle, do your duty!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look! Look there, mammy!&#8221; cried his eldest
son. &#8220;Look there! Look there!&#8221; and he sprang
to his mother&#8217;s side, as two tiny fellows rose like
light from the bottle; and in an instant they covered
the table with dishes and plates of gold and
silver, full of the finest victuals that ever were
seen. And when all was done, the two tiny fellows
went into the bottle again.</p>

<p>Mick and his wife looked at everything with
astonishment; they had never seen such dishes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
and plates before, and the very sight of them almost
took their appetites away. But at length
Molly said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come and sit down, Mick, and try to eat a
bit. Sure, you ought to be hungry, after such a
good day&#8217;s work!&#8221;</p>

<p>So they all sat down at the table. After they
had eaten as much as they wished, Molly said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder will those two good, little gentlemen
carry away these fine things.&#8221;</p>

<p>They waited, but no one came; so Molly put
the dishes and plates carefully aside. The next
day Mick went to Cork and sold some of them,
and bought a horse and cart.</p>

<p>Weeks passed by, and the neighbours saw that
Mick was making money; and, though he and
his wife did all they could to keep the bottle a
secret, their landlord soon found out about it.
Then he took the bottle by force away from Mick,
and carried it carefully home.</p>

<p>As for Mick and his wife, they had so much
money left that the loss of the bottle did not
worry them much at first; but they kept on
spending their wealth as if there was no end to
it. And to make a long story short, they became
poorer and poorer, until they had to sell their
last cow.</p>

<p>So one morning early, Mick once more drove
his cow to the Fair of Cork. It was hardly daybreak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
when he left home, and he walked on until
he reached the big hill; and just as he got to its
top, and cast his eyes before and around him, up
started the little man out of the hill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Mick Purcell,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I told you that
you would be a rich man!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, then, so I was, that is no lie for you,
sir,&#8221; replied Mick. &#8220;But it&#8217;s not rich I am now!
And if you happen to have another bottle, here
is the cow for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And here is the bottle!&#8221; said the little man,
smiling. &#8220;You know what to do with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with that both the cow and the stranger
disappeared as they had done before.</p>

<p>Mick hurried away, anxious to get home with
the bottle. He arrived with it safely enough, and
called out to Molly to put the room to rights; and
to lay a clean cloth on the table. Which she did.</p>

<p>Mick set the bottle on the ground, and cried
out: &#8220;Bottle, do your duty!&#8221;</p>

<p>In a twinkling two great, stout men with two
huge clubs, issued from the bottle, and belaboured
poor Mick and his family until they lay groaning
on the floor. Then the two men went into the
bottle again.</p>

<p>Mick, as soon as he came to himself, got up and
looked around him. He thought and he thought.
He lifted up his wife and children, then leaving
them to recover as best they could, he put the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
bottle under his arm, and went to visit his landlord.</p>

<p>The landlord was having a great feast, and
when he saw that Mick had another bottle, he
invited him heartily to come in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Show us your bottle, Mick,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>So Mick set it on the floor, and spoke the proper
words; and in a moment the landlord tumbled
to the floor, and all his guests were running, and
roaring, and sprawling, and kicking, and shrieking,
while the two great, stout men belaboured
them well.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop those two scoundrels, Mick Purcell,&#8221;
shouted the landlord, &#8220;or I&#8217;ll hang you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They shall never stop,&#8221; said Mick, &#8220;till I get
my own bottle that I see on top of yon shelf.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give it to him! Give it to him, before we are
killed!&#8221; cried the landlord.</p>

<p>Mick put his old bottle in his bosom. Then
the two great, stout men jumped into the new
one, and Mick carried both bottles safely home.</p>

<p>And to make my story short, from that time on
Mick prospered. He got richer than ever, and
his son married the landlord&#8217;s daughter. And
both Mick and his wife lived to a great old age.
They died on the same day, and at their wake the
servants broke both bottles. But the hill has the
name upon it; for so it will always be Bottle Hill
to the end of the world, for this is a strange story.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">THE BOY WHO FOUND THE POTS
OF GOLD</h4></div>

<p class="center"><i>From Ireland</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was once a poor boy who used to drive his
cart along the road, and sell turf to the neighbours.
He was a strange boy, very silent, and
spent his evenings in his little hut, where he lived
alone, reading old bits of books he had picked up
in his rambles. And as he read, he longed to be
rich and live in a fine house with a garden all
round him, and to have plenty of books.</p>

<p>Now he once read how the Fairies&#8217; Shoemakers,
the Leprechauns&mdash;merry, tricksy little sprites&mdash;sit
at sunset under the hedges mending the
shoes of Elfin Folk. And how they chuckle as
they work, for they know where the pots of Fairy
Gold are hidden.</p>

<p>So, evening after evening, the boy watched
the hedges hoping to catch a glimpse of a little
cobbler, and to hear the click-clack of his tiny
hammer.</p>

<p>At last, one evening, just as the sun was setting,
the boy saw a little Leprechaun sitting under
a dock-leaf, and working away hard on a small
boot. He was dressed in green and wore a red cap
on his head. The boy jumped down from his cart,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
and catching the Leprechaun by the neck, cried
merrily:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ho! Ho! My fine little man, you can&#8217;t get
away until you tell me where the Fairy Gold is
hidden!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Easy now!&#8221; said the little man, laughing.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t hurt me, and I&#8217;ll tell you all about it. I
could harm you, if I wished, for I have the power;
but I like you, and you are an industrious lad. So
carry me to yonder fort, and I&#8217;ll show you the
gold.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carrying the Leprechaun carefully, the boy
took a few steps, and found himself close to the
ruins of an old fort. A door opened in a stone wall,
and he walked in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now look around,&#8221; said the Leprechaun.</p>

<p>Then the boy saw that the whole ground was
covered with gold pieces, while pots full of gold and
silver money stood about in such plenty that it
seemed as if all the riches of the world were there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take what you want,&#8221; said the Leprechaun,
&#8220;and be quick about it; for if the door shuts you
will never leave this place alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy hurried, and gathered his arms full of
gold and silver, and hastening out of the door,
flung all into the cart. Then he brought out some
of the pots; but when he was on his way back for
more, the door shut with a clap like thunder, and
night fell, and all was dark.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>The boy saw no more of the Leprechaun; and
as he could not even thank him, he thought that
it was best to drive home at once and hide his
treasure.</p>

<p>When he reached his hut, he counted all the
bright yellow pieces and shining silver ones, and
found that he was as rich as a king. And because
he was wise, he told no one about his adventure,
but the next day drove to town and put all his
money in the bank.</p>

<p>After that he ordered a fine house, and laid out
a spacious garden, and had servants, and carriages,
and many books. Then he married the
daughter of a magistrate, and became great and
powerful. His memory is still held in reverence
by his townspeople. His descendants are living
rich and happy; and no matter how much they
give to the poor, their wealth always increases.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">THE RAGWEED</h4></div>

<p class="center"><i>From Ireland</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> was as clean, clever, and tight looking a lad
as any in the whole county Cork. One fine holiday
in harvest-time, he was taking a ramble and
was sauntering along the sunny side of a hedge,
when suddenly he heard a crackling sound among
the leaves.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me!&#8221; said he, &#8220;but isn&#8217;t it really surprising
to hear the stone-chats singing so late in
the season!&#8221;</p>

<p>And with that he stole along, going on the tips
of his toes, to see if he could get sight of what was
making the noise. He looked sharply under the
bushes, and what should he see in a nook in the
hedge but a big brown pitcher holding a gallon
or more of dark looking liquor. And standing
close to it was a little, diny, dony bit of an old
man as big as your thumb, with a tiny cocked
hat stuck on the top of his head, and a deesy,
daushy, leather apron hanging down before him.</p>

<p>The little old man pulled a little brown stool
from under the hedge, and, standing upon it,
dipped a little cup into the pitcher. Then he
took the cup out, full of the brown liquor, and
putting it on the ground, sat down on the stool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
under the shadow of the pitcher. He began to
put a heel-piece on a bit of a boot just the size
for himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless my soul!&#8221; said Tom to himself, in great
surprise, &#8220;I&#8217;ve often heard tell of the Leprechauns,
but I never rightly believed in them! But
here&#8217;s one in real earnest! Now if I set about
things right, I&#8217;m a made man! Folks say that a
body must never take his eyes off them or they&#8217;ll
get away.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Tom stole nearer, with his eyes fixed on the
little man, just as a cat does with a mouse. And
when he got close up to him, he said softly:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;How goes your work, neighbour?&#8221;</p>

<p>The little man raised his head. &#8220;Very well,
thank you kindly,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m surprised that you should be working on
a holiday,&#8221; said Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my own business, not yours,&#8221; said
the little man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, will you be civil enough to tell me what&#8217;s
in your pitcher?&#8221; said Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;That I will, with pleasure,&#8221; said the little
man. &#8220;&#8217;Tis Elfin beer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Elfin beer!&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;Thunder and fire!
Where did you get it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why I made it&mdash;I made it of heath,&#8221; said
the little man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of heath!&#8221; said Tom bursting out laughing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
&#8220;And will you give a body a taste of it?&#8221; asked
he.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what it is, young man,&#8221; said the
Leprechaun, &#8220;it would be fitter for you to be
looking after your cows that have broken into
the oats yonder, than to stand here asking honest
folks foolish questions!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom was so taken by surprise at this, that he
was just going to turn his head to look for the
cows, when he remembered not to take his eyes
off the Leprechaun. Instead, he made a grab at
the little man and caught him up in his hand;
but, as bad luck would have it, he overturned the
pitcher with his foot, and all the liquor was spilt.</p>

<p>&#8220;You little rogue!&#8221; cried he, shaking the Leprechaun
hard, and looking very wicked and angry.
&#8220;Tell me where your gold is hidden, and show
me all your money!&#8221;</p>

<p>At that the little man was quite frightened.
&#8220;Come along with me,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll show
you a crock of gold in a field over there.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they went, Tom holding the Leprechaun
very tightly, and never taking his eyes off him.
They crossed hedges and ditches and a crooked
bit of bog, until they came to a great field of ragweed.
Then the Leprechaun pointed to one of
the weeds, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dig under that, and you&#8217;ll get a crock full of
guineas.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>As Tom had no spade with him, he thought to
himself: &#8220;I&#8217;ll run home and fetch one. And so
that I&#8217;ll know the place again, I&#8217;ll tie my garter
around this weed.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he tied his red garter around the ragweed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; said the Leprechaun politely,
&#8220;that now you have no further use for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;you may go, if you wish.
And thank you very kindly,&#8221; he said, laughing
loudly, &#8220;for showing me where all your money
lies!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, good-bye to you, Tom,&#8221; said the little
man, &#8220;and much good may it do you, what you&#8217;ll
get,&#8221; said he; and with that he jumped behind
the weed, and vanished.</p>

<p>So Tom ran home for dear life and fetched a
spade, and then back as hard as he could go to
the field.</p>

<p>But when he got there, lo, and behold! not a
ragweed in the whole field but had a red garter,
just like his own, tied to it! And as for digging up
that whole field, it was out of the question, for
there were more than forty good Irish acres in it.</p>

<p>So Tom went home again with his spade, a
little cooler, and, you may be sure, ashamed to
tell any one about the neat turn the Leprechaun
had served him.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">THE BAD BOY AND THE
LEPRECHAUN</h4></div>

<p class="center"><i>From Ireland</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Now</span>, it is well known that if a Leprechaun is
offended he can be most malicious. So one must
treat him politely, or he will not reveal where the
pots of Fairy Gold are hidden.</p>

<p>It happened one afternoon that a lad was working
in the fields when he heard at his feet, &#8220;Rip!
Rap! Tick! Tack!&#8221; and looking down he saw a
little fellow no bigger than his hand sitting under
a burdock-leaf, mending shoes. He grabbed him
up, and putting him in his pocket, ran home.
There was no one in the house, so he tied the
Leprechaun to the hob, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me, you little rogue, where I may find a
pot of gold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That I will not tell you,&#8221; replied the Leprechaun,
&#8220;unless you let me go, so that I may finish
cobbling the Elfin King&#8217;s shoes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make you tell me <i>now</i> where the gold is!&#8221;
said the lad.</p>

<p>And with that he built a rousing fire under the
Leprechaun to roast him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, take me off! Take me off!&#8221; yelled the
little fellow, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll tell you! Just go to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
burdock-leaf under which I was sitting, and there
is the pot of gold. Only go, dig, and find it, before
the sun sets.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lad was so delighted that, without stopping
to untie the Leprechaun, he ran out of the
house. It happened that his mother was just
coming in with a pail of new milk. He hit the
pail and spilt the milk on the floor, but he ran on
laughing. And when his mother saw the Leprechaun
struggling on the hob, she was furiously
angry.</p>

<p>&#8220;See what bad luck you have brought us, you
rogue!&#8221; she cried. And with that she untied the
little fellow and kicked him out of the house.</p>

<p>But the lad ran on until he came to the burdock-leaf;
and he dug, and dug, and dug, but
there was no pot of gold there, for the sun had
set. So he started sorrowfully for home, and just
as he was passing an old fort he heard laughter,
and a squeaky voice crying out:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;That boy is looking for a pot of gold! ha! ha!
But little does he know that a whole crock full
is lying at the bottom of the old quarry. Only
he must go to fetch it at midnight, and he must
not take his mother with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the lad heard this he hurried home and
told his mother. At midnight he started out,
after ordering her to stay in the house. But as
soon as he was gone she thought to herself: &#8220;I&#8217;ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
get to the quarry before he does, and find and
keep the gold!&#8221;</p>

<p>So she ran by a shorter way, and when she
reached the edge of the quarry she slipped on a
stone, fell to the bottom, and broke her leg. And
there she lay groaning dreadfully.</p>

<p>Soon the lad came along, and just as he was
going to climb down he heard some one groan.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s below?&#8221; he cried in a fright. &#8220;Is it
evil? Is it good?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your mother with a broken leg,&#8221; groaned
she.</p>

<p>&#8220;And is this my pot of gold!&#8221; exclaimed the
lad, angrily.</p>

<p>And with that he ran for a neighbour, and together
they drew the woman up and took her
home. And from that day on she was lame.</p>

<p>As for the Leprechaun, he is still sitting under
the burdock-leaf, and he laughs at the lad and his
mother, as he mends his little shoes with his tiny
hammer, Rip! Rap! Tick! Tack!&mdash;but they are
afraid to touch him, for they know he can punish
them badly.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">TOM AND THE KNOCKERS</h4></div>

<p class="center"><i>From Cornwall</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">From</span> the time that Tom was old enough to handle
pick and shovel, he had worked in the tin
mines. And very lucky he was, always finding
rich lodes of tin, or stumbling on heaps of Cornish
diamonds that some unknown hands had
piled up to carry off.</p>

<p>One night Tom was working hard in an old
mine&mdash;a very ancient mine indeed&mdash;when he
heard sounds like those of tiny shovels and
picks.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis the Knockers!&#8221; said Tom to himself,
and he listened quietly. Then he heard, as if
only two or three yards away, little miners doing
all sorts of underground work. Some were
wheeling barrows, others were shovelling; and he
could distinguish even the sounds of boring,
swabbing the holes, and blasting.</p>

<p>The noises came nearer and nearer, and Tom
heard distinctly many squeaky voices all talking
at once, and strange cackling laughter. He grew
quite savage listening to all this clatter, and to
the squeaking and tee-hee-ing; and being a rash
fellow, he struck the wall before him violently
with his pick, and threw a handful of stones in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
the direction where the Knockers seemed to be
working.</p>

<p>&#8220;Scat!&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;or I&#8217;ll beat your brains
out, I will, if you don&#8217;t leave here!&#8221;</p>

<p>The words were scarcely out of his mouth, when
a shower of stones fell all around him, and on
him, and frightened him nearly out of his senses.
Still he was resolved to work there until morning
and so he kept on using his pick for about an
hour. Then, as his candle was burned out, he
stopped, lit another, and sat down to eat his
breakfast.</p>

<p>He had almost finished his bread and cheese,
when he heard many little squeaking voices, some
far away, and others close to him, crying out:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom! Tom! Leave us a bite of your breakfast,
or bad luck to you, to-morrow, Tom!&#8221;</p>

<p>At first he could not make out the words, only
his own name, then the cries sounded very plain,
and he was angry. &#8220;Leave the little rogues a bite
of my good breakfast!&#8221; thought he, &#8220;not a crumb
of it do they get!&#8221; And with that he ate the last
morsel.</p>

<p>Then he heard the little voices squeaking
louder than before:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom! Tom! We&#8217;ll send you bad luck to-morrow,
Tom! you greedy creature not to leave
a single crumb for the Knockers!&#8221;</p>

<p>And they kept on squeaking, and tee-heeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
in a mocking way; but getting farther and farther
in the distance until they were quite gone.</p>

<p>Then Tom felt tired and drowsy, and lay down
on the floor to sleep awhile.</p>

<p>When he waked, the place was very still. He
rubbed his eyes, and saw a score of Knockers
leaning on their tools, and standing in a circle
around him. They were little, withered old men,
with legs like drum-sticks, and arms longer and
thinner than their legs. They kept nodding their
great ugly heads, squinting their horrid eyes,
wriggling their hooked noses, and grinning from
ear to ear.</p>

<p>Tom lay there trembling and frightened almost
to death. Then the oldest and ugliest of
the Knockers came close to him, and stooping,
made the most horrid grimaces in Tom&#8217;s face;
while all the others lolled out their tongues, and
rolled themselves into balls, and grinned at him
from between their spindle-legs.</p>

<p>Then Tom saw that his candle was sputtering
and just going out, and he sprang to his feet to
light another. As he did so, all the little men
vanished. They seemed to melt away one into
the other like puffs of smoke.</p>

<p>Feeling very stiff and tired, Tom mounted the
ladders, and left the mine. When he told the old
tinners what he had seen, they were not surprised,
for it was well known among them that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
the mine Tom had been working in was the abode
of troops of Knockers. But the tinners, one and
all, blamed Tom for speaking to the little men
in an unfriendly way, and for not leaving them
a bite of his breakfast.</p>

<p>From that time on, all Tom&#8217;s luck was gone.
The mines closed down, and his money went,
and he was hurt by a fall. And though he tried
hard to find the Knockers again, so that he
might feed them well, he never saw one, nor even
heard the sounds of their picks and shovels in
the mine.</p>

<p class="center"><i>From Cornwall</i></p>


<h5>JACK THE TINNER&#8217;S STORY</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> night I was working away for dear life, in
yonder old tin mine. I was in good heart, because
at every stroke of my tool I heard three or
four clicks from Knockers who were working
ahead. By the sounds they seemed to be very
near.</p>

<p>Just then a hard stroke of my pick broke open
the rock in front of me, and I saw into a large
grotto. The light of my candle fell on its walls,
and my eyes were dazzled by the glistening of
bunches of diamonds and crystals of all colours
that hung down from the roof, and encrusted
the sides.</p>

<p>While I was rubbing my eyes, I saw three little
Knockers. They were no bigger than sixpenny
dolls, yet their faces were old and strange. The
eldest one was sitting on a stone, his jacket off,
and his shirt-sleeves rolled up. Between his
knees he held a tiny anvil, and he was sharpening
a borer about the size of a needle, for one of the
Knockers. The third little fellow was awaiting
his turn, pick-axe in hand.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>When the Knocker-smith had finished sharpening
the borer, he rested his hammer on the
anvil, and looked toward me.</p>

<p>&#8220;What cheer, comrade?&#8221; he said. &#8220;I could not
think from where the cold wind was coming. The
draught from your hole has blown out my light.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Good-morning! Is that you? How are
you?&#8221; said I. &#8220;And how is the rest of your family?
I am glad to see you. I&#8217;ll fetch you my
candle in a minute, that you may see better. In
fact, I&#8217;ll give you a pound of candles, my dear,
with all my heart, if you want them,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>In less than no time I put my hand through the
hole to give him my candle, when, what do you
think?&mdash;there wasn&#8217;t a Knocker in sight!</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are they gone?&#8221; thought I. Then I
heard them somewhere in the lode ahead, tee-heeing,
and cackling, and squeaking like young
rabbits.</p>

<p>And there I was left in their pretty workshop,
with bunches of diamonds all around me. I laid
my coat on the floor, and filled it with diamonds
and coloured crystals, and then hurried out of
the mine. But when I went back to get some
more, the rocks had caved in, and I never could
find the grotto again.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">SKILLYWIDDEN</h4></div>

<p class="center"><i>From Cornwall</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Every</span> one knows that before King Arthur ruled
in Britain, the Danes conquered Cornwall. Then
many of the rich Cornish folk buried their gold
and treasures, and fled to the land of Wales. A
few years after that King Arthur came with his
knights, and drove the Danes out of Cornwall.
Then the folk came back, but never again could
they find their buried treasures. And to-day
none but the Spriggans know where the gold is
hidden.</p>

<p>Well, one morning not very long ago Uncle
Billy of Trevidga was out on the side of a hill,
cutting away the furze that was as high as his
head, with bare places here and there covered
with white clover, heath, and whortleberries.
Uncle Billy was working hard, when he spied the
prettiest little creature, a real little man, not
bigger than a kitten, sleeping on a bank of wild
thyme. He was dressed in a green coat, sky-blue
breeches, and diamond-buckled shoes. His tiny
cocked hat was drawn over his face, to shade it
from the sun.</p>

<p>Uncle Billy stooped and looked at him, and
longed to carry him home to his children, for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
had a houseful of little ones, boys and girls. So
he took off his cuff, and slipped it quickly over
the Spriggan&mdash;for a Spriggan it was that lay
there&mdash;before he could wake.</p>

<p>The little fellow opened his pretty eyes, and
said in a sleepy voice: &#8220;Mammy! Where are
you? Mammy! Daddy!&#8221; Then he saw Uncle
Billy looking at him. &#8220;Who are you?&#8221; he
said. &#8220;You&#8217;re a fine, great giant! I want my
Mammy! Can you find her for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know where she is,&#8221; answered Uncle
Billy. &#8220;But come home with me, and play with
my children, until your Mammy finds you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said the Spriggan. &#8220;I love to
ride goats over the rocks, and to have milk and
blackberries for supper. Will you give me some?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, my son,&#8221; said Uncle Billy; and with
that he picked up the Spriggan gently, and carried
him home.</p>

<p>Well, you should have seen the children! They
were so happy to own a Spriggan! They set the
little fellow on the hearth, and he played with
them as if he had known them always. Uncle
Billy and his wife were delighted, and the children
shouted for joy, when the pretty little man
capered and jumped about. They called him
Bobby Spriggan. Twice a day they gave him a
wee mug of milk and a few blackberries, and now
and then some haws for a change.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>In the mornings, while Uncle Billy&#8217;s wife and
the children were doing the housework, Bobby
Spriggan sat perched on the faggots in the wood-corner,
and sang and chirped away like a Robin
Redbreast.</p>

<p>When the hearth was swept, and the kitchen
made tidy, and Uncle Billy&#8217;s wife was knitting,
Bobby would dance for hours on the hearthstone.
The faster her needles clicked, the faster
he danced and spun around and around. And
the children laughed and clapped their hands,
and danced with him.</p>

<p>A week or so after Bobby Spriggan had been
found, Uncle Billy had to leave home. As he
wished to keep the little fellow safe and sound
until he told where the crocks of Cornish gold
were hidden, Uncle Billy shut him up with the
youngest children in the barn, and put a strong
padlock on the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now stay in the barn and play,&#8221; called Uncle
Billy to the children. &#8220;And don&#8217;t try to get out,
or when I come home you&#8217;ll get a walloping,&#8221;
said he, and then went away.</p>

<p>The children laughed a part of the time, and a
part of the time they cried, for they did not like
to be locked in the barn. But Bobby Spriggan
was as merry as a cricket. He danced and sang,
and peeped through the cracks in the wall at the
men who were working in the fields. And when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
the men went to dinner, up jumped Bobby and
unbarred a window.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along, children!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Now for
a game of hide-and-seek in the furze!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he sprang out the window, and the children
followed after. And away they all ran to
play in the furze.</p>

<p>They were shouting and throwing whortleberries
about, when suddenly they saw a little
man and woman no bigger than Bobby. The
little man was dressed like Bobby, except that
he wore high riding-boots with silver spurs. The
little woman&#8217;s green gown was spangled with
glittering stars. Diamond shoe-buckles shone on
her high-heeled shoes, and her tiny steeple-crowned
hat was perched on a pile of golden
curls, wreathed with heath blossoms. The pretty
little soul was weeping and wringing her hands,
and crying:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;O my dear, tender Skillywidden! Where
canst thou be! Shall I never set eyes on thee
again, my only one, my only joy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go back! Go back!&#8221; cried Bobby Spriggan
to the children. Then he called out: &#8220;Here I am,
Mammy!&#8221;</p>

<p>And just as he said, &#8220;Here I am,&#8221; the little man
and the little woman, and Bobby Spriggan himself,
who was their precious Skillywidden, vanished,
and were seen no more.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>The children cried and cried, and went home.
And when Uncle Billy came back you may be
sure that he whipped them all soundly. And it
served them right, for if they had minded and
stayed in the barn, Bobby Spriggan would have
shown Uncle Billy where the Cornish gold was
hidden.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">LITTLE REDCAP</h4></div>

<p class="center"><i>From Ireland</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Sure</span> and it was in old Ireland, some years ago,
that Tom Coghlan returned one evening to his
house, expecting to find the fire blazing, the
potatoes boiling, and his wife and children as
merry as grigs. But, instead, the fire was out,
his wife was scolding, and the children were all
crying from hunger.</p>

<p>Poor Tom was quite astonished to find matters
going on so badly, for, though there was a
plenty of potatoes in the house, there wasn&#8217;t a
single stick of wood for the fire. Something had
to be done. And Tom bethought himself of the
great furze-bushes that grew around the ruins
of the old fort on top of the near-by hill. So he
snatched up his axe and away he went.</p>

<p>Before he reached the top of the hill the sun
had gone down, and the moon had risen and was
shedding her wavering, watery light on the ruins
of the old fort. The breeze rustled the dark
furze-bushes with an eerie sound, and Tom shivered
with dread. But he braced up his heart, and,
approaching the fort, raised his axe to cut down
a big bush. Just then, near him, he heard the
shriek of a small, shrill voice.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>Tom, startled, let the axe fall from his grasp,
and, looking up, saw perched on the furze-bush
in front of him a little old man, not more than a
foot and a half high. He wore a red cap. His
face was the colour of a withered mushroom,
while his sparkling eyes, twinkling like diamonds
in the dark, illuminated his distorted face. His
thin legs dangled from his fat, round body.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ho! Ho!&#8221; said the Little Redcap, &#8220;is that
what you&#8217;re after, Tom Coghlan? What did me
and mine ever do to you that you should cut
down our bushes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, then, nothing at all, your honour!&#8221;
said Tom, recovering a bit from his fright, &#8220;nothing
at all! Only the children were crying from
hunger, and I thought I&#8217;d make bold to cut a
bush or two to boil the potatoes, for we haven&#8217;t
a stick in the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t cut down these bushes, Tom!&#8221;
said the Little Redcap. &#8220;But, as you are an
honest man, I&#8217;ll buy them from you, though I
have a better right to them than you have. So,
if you&#8217;ll take my advice, carry this mill home
with you, and let the bushes alone,&#8221; said the
Little Redcap, holding out a tiny stone mill for
grinding meal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mill, indeed!&#8221; said Tom, looking with astonishment
at the thing, which was so small that he
could have put it with ease into his breeches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
pocket. &#8220;Mill, indeed! And what good will a
bit of a thing like that do me? Sure, it won&#8217;t
boil the potatoes for the children!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What good will it do you?&#8221; said the Little
Redcap. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what good it will do you!
It will make you and your family as fat and
strong as so many stall-fed bullocks. And if it
won&#8217;t boil the potatoes, it will do a great deal
better, for you have only to grind it, and it will
give you the greatest plenty of elegant meal.
But if you ever sell any of the meal, that moment
the mill will lose its power.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bargain,&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;So give me the
mill, and you&#8217;re heartily welcome to the bushes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There it is for you, Tom,&#8221; said the Little
Redcap, throwing the mill down to him; &#8220;there
it is for you, and much good may it do you!
But remember you are not to sell the meal on
any account.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me alone for that!&#8221; said Tom.</p>

<p>And then he made the best of his way home,
where his wife was trying to comfort the children,
wondering all the time what in the world was
keeping Tom. And when she saw him return
without so much as one stick of wood to boil the
potatoes, her anger burst out. But Tom soon
quieted her by placing the mill on the table and
telling her how he had got it from the Little
Redcap.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>&#8220;We&#8217;ll try it directly,&#8221; said she. And they
pulled the table into the middle of the floor, and
commenced grinding away with the mill. Before
long a stream of beautiful meal began pouring
from it; and in a short time they had filled every
dish and pail in the house. Tom&#8217;s wife was delighted,
as you may believe, and the children
managed the best they could for that night by
eating plenty of raw meal.</p>

<p>Well, after that everything went very well with
Tom and his family. The mill gave them all the
meal they wanted, and they grew as fat and sleek
as coach-horses. But one morning when Tom was
away from home, his wife needed money. So
she took a few pecks of the meal to town and sold
it in the market.</p>

<p>And sorry enough she was, for that night, when
Tom came home and began to grind the mill,
not a speck of meal would come from it! He
could not for the life of him find out the reason,
for his wife was afraid to tell him about her
selling the meal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, and the little old fellow cheated me
well!&#8221; thought Tom, as mad as a nest of hornets.
So he put his axe under his arm, and away he
went to the old fort, determined to punish the
Little Redcap by cutting down his bushes. But
scarcely had he lifted his axe, when the Little Redcap
appeared, and mighty angry he was, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
that Tom should come cutting his bushes, after
having made a fair bargain with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You deceitful, little, ugly vagabond!&#8221; cried
Tom, flourishing his axe, &#8220;to give me a mill
that wasn&#8217;t worth a sixpence! If you don&#8217;t
give me a good one for it, I&#8217;ll cut down every
bush!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a blusterer you are, Tom!&#8221; said the
Little Redcap, &#8220;but you&#8217;d better be easy and
let the bushes alone, or maybe you&#8217;ll pay for it!
Deceive you, indeed! Didn&#8217;t I tell you that
mill would lose its power if you sold any of the
meal?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And sure and I didn&#8217;t, either,&#8221; said Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s all one for that,&#8221; answered the Little
Redcap, &#8220;for if you didn&#8217;t, your wife did. And
as to giving you another mill, it&#8217;s out of the question.
For the one I gave you was the only one
in the fort. And a hard battle we had to get it
away from another party of the Good People!
But I&#8217;ll tell you what I&#8217;ll do with you, Tom;
let the bushes alone, and I&#8217;ll make a doctor of
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A doctor, indeed!&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s
a fool you&#8217;re making of me!&#8221;</p>

<p>But it was no such thing, for the Little Redcap
gave Tom Coghlan a charm so that he could
cure any sick person. And Tom took it home,
and became a great man with a very full purse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
He gave good schooling to his children. One of
them he made a grand butter-merchant in the
city of Cork, and the youngest son&mdash;being ever
and always a well-spoken lad&mdash;he made a lawyer;
and his two daughters married well.</p>

<p>And Tom is as happy as a man can be!</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">THE CURMUDGEON&#8217;S SKIN</h4></div>

<p class="center"><i>From Ireland</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is well known in old Ireland that a Four-leaved
Shamrock has the power to open a man&#8217;s eyes
so that he can see all kinds of enchantments, and
this is what happened to Billy Thompson:&mdash;</p>

<p>One misfortune after another decreased his
goods. His sheep died; and his pig got the measles,
so that he was obliged to sell it for little or
nothing. But still he had his cow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Billy to his wife, for he was a
good-humoured fellow, and always made the best
of things,&mdash;&#8220;Well!&#8221; said he, &#8220;it can&#8217;t be helped!
Anyhow, we&#8217;ll not want the drop of milk to our
potatoes, as long as the cow&#8217;s left to comfort
us!&#8221;</p>

<p>The words were hardly out of his mouth when
a neighbour came running up to tell him that his
cow had fallen from a cliff, and was lying dead
in the Horses&#8217; Glen. For Billy, you must know,
had sent his cow that very morning to graze on
the cliff.</p>

<p>&#8220;Och! Ullagone!&#8221; cried Billy. &#8220;What&#8217;ll we
do now! Och! you cruel, unnatural beast as to
clift yourself, when you knowed as well as myself
that we couldn&#8217;t do without you at all! For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
sure enough now the children will be crying for
the drop of milk to their potatoes!&#8221;</p>

<p>Such was Billy&#8217;s lament, as with a sorrowful
heart he made the best of his way to the Horses&#8217;
Glen. &#8220;Anyway,&#8221; thought he, &#8220;I&#8217;ll skin the carcass,
and the meat will make fine broth for the
children.&#8221;</p>

<p>It took him some time to find where the poor
beast was lying, but at last he did find her, all
smashed to pieces at the foot of a big rock. And
he began to skin her as fast as he could, but having
no one to help him, by the time the job was
finished, the sun had gone down.</p>

<p>Now Billy was so intent on his work that he
did not perceive the lapse of time, but when he
raised his head and saw the darkness coming on,
and listened to the murmuring wind, all the tales
he had ever heard of the Pooka, the Banshee,
and Little Redcap, the mischievous Fairy,
floated through his mind, and made him want to
get home as fast as possible. He snatched a tuft
of grass, wiped his knife, and seized hold of the
hide.</p>

<p>It so happened that in the little tuft of grass
with which Billy wiped his knife was a Four-leaved
Shamrock. And whether from grief or
fear, Billy, instead of throwing away the grass,
put it in his pocket along with his knife. And
when he stood up and turned to take a last look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
at the carcass he saw, instead of his poor cow, a
little old Curmudgeon sitting bolt upright, looking
as if he had just been skinned alive!</p>

<p>&#8220;Billy Thompson! Billy Thompson,&#8221; cried
the little old fellow in a shrill, squeaking voice.
&#8220;You spalpeen! You&#8217;d better come back with
my skin! A pretty time of day we&#8217;ve come to,
when a gentleman like me cannot take a bit of
sleep but a rude fellow must come and strip the
hide off him! But you&#8217;d better bring it back,
Billy Thompson, or I&#8217;ll make you remember
how you dared to skin me, you spalpeen!&#8221;</p>

<p>Now Billy, though he was greatly frightened,
remembered that he had a black-handled knife
in his pocket, and whoever has that, &#8217;tis said,
can look all the Fairies of the world in the face
without quaking. So he put his hand on the knife,
and began backing away, with the skin under his
arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, then, your honour,&#8221; said he, &#8220;if it&#8217;s
this skin you&#8217;re wanting, you must know it&#8217;s
the skin of my poor cow that was clifted yonder
there. And sore and sorrowful the children will
be for the want of her little drop of milk!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, then, if that&#8217;s what you&#8217;d be after,
Billy, my boy,&#8221; said the little fellow, at the same
time jumping before him with the speed of a
greyhound, &#8220;do you think I&#8217;m such a fool
as to let you walk off with my skin? If you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
don&#8217;t drop it in the turn of a hand, you&#8217;ll sup
sorrow!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; said Billy, drawing out his black-handled
knife, and holding it so the little man
could see it. &#8220;Never a one of me will let you
have this skin till you give me back my cow. I
know well enough she was not clifted at all, at
all, and that you and the other Curmudgeons
have got hold of her!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better keep a civil tongue in your
head,&#8221; said the little fellow, who seemed to get
quite soft at the sight of the knife. &#8220;But you&#8217;re
a brave boy, Billy Thompson, and I&#8217;ve taken a
fancy to you! I don&#8217;t say but I might get you
your cow again, if you&#8217;ll give me back my skin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you kindly,&#8221; said Billy, winking slyly.
&#8220;Give me the cow first; then I will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there she is for you, you unbelieving
hound!&#8221; said the little Curmudgeon.</p>

<p>And for sure and for certain, what did Billy
Thompson hear but his own cow bellowing behind
him for the bare life! And when he looked back
what should he see but his cow running over rocks
and stones with a long rope hanging to one of her
legs, and four little fellows, with red caps on them,
hunting her as fast as they could!</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;ll be a battle for her, Billy! There&#8217;ll
be a battle!&#8221; laughed the little Curmudgeon.</p>

<p>And sure enough, the little Redcaps began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
fight, and in the meantime the cow, finding herself
at liberty, ran towards Billy, who lost not a
minute, but, throwing the skin on the ground,
seized the cow by the tail and began to drive
her away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so fast, Billy!&#8221; said the little Curmudgeon,
who stuck close by his side; &#8220;not so fast!
Though I gave you the cow, I didn&#8217;t give you
the rope that&#8217;s hanging to her leg.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A bargain&#8217;s a bargain,&#8221; said Billy, &#8220;so as
I&#8217;ve got it, I&#8217;ll keep rope and all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you say that again,&#8221; said the little fellow,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll be after calling the Redcaps that are fighting
below there. But I don&#8217;t want to be too hard
on you, Billy, for if you have a mind for the rope,
I&#8217;ll give it to you for the little tuft of grass you
have in your pocket.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There, take it,&#8221; said Billy, throwing down
the grass with the Four-leaved Shamrock in it.</p>

<p>No sooner was it out of his hand than he received
such a blow that it dashed him to the
ground, insensible. When he came to himself,
the sun was shining, and where should he be but
near his own house with the cow grazing beside
him? Billy Thompson could hardly believe his
eyes, and thought it was all a dream, till he saw
the rope hanging to his cow&#8217;s leg.</p>

<p>And that was a lucky rope for him! For, from
that day out, his cow gave more milk than any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
six cows in the parish, and Billy began to look
up in the world. He took farms, and purchased
cattle till he became very rich. But no one could
ever get him to go to the Horses&#8217; Glen. And to-day
he never passes an old fort, or hears a blast
of wind, without taking off his hat in compliment
to the Good People; and &#8217;tis only right that he
should.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">JUDY AND THE FAIRY CAT</h4></div>

<p class="center"><i>From Ireland</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Late</span> one Hallowe&#8217;en an old woman was sitting
up spinning. There came a soft knock at the
door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s there?&#8221; asked she.</p>

<p>There was no answer, but another knock.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s there?&#8221; she asked a second time.</p>

<p>Still no answer, but a third knock. At that the
old woman got up in anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s there?&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>A small voice, like a child&#8217;s, sobbed: &#8220;Ah,
Judy dear, let me in! I am so cold and hungry!
Open the door, Judy dear, and let me sit by the
fire and dry myself! Judy dear, let me in! Oh&mdash;let&mdash;me&mdash;in!&#8221;</p>

<p>Judy, thinking that it must be a small child
who had lost its way, ran to the door, and opened
it. In walked a large Black Cat waving her tail,
and two black kittens followed her. They walked
deliberately across the floor, and sat down before
the fire, and began to warm themselves and lick
their fur, purring all the time. Judy never said
a word, but closed the door, and went back to
her spinning.</p>

<p>At last the Black Cat spoke.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>&#8220;Judy dear,&#8221; said she, &#8220;do not sit up so late.
This is the Fairies&#8217; holiday, and they wish to
hold a counsel in your kitchen, and eat their supper
here. They are very angry because you are
still up, and they cannot come in. Indeed, Judy,
they are determined to kill you. Only for myself
and my two daughters, you would now be dead.
So take my advice and do not interfere with the
Fairies&#8217; Hallowe&#8217;en. But give me some milk, for
I must be off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, Judy got up in a great fright and ran as
fast as she could, and brought three saucers full
of milk, and set them on the floor before the cats.
They lapped up all the milk, then the Black Cat
called her daughters and stood up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Judy dear,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You
have been very civil to me, and I&#8217;ll not forget.
Good night! Good night!&#8221;</p>

<p>And with that she and her kittens whisked up
the chimney, and were gone.</p>

<p>Then Judy saw something shining on the
hearth. She picked it up; it was a piece of silver
money, more than she could earn in a month.
She put out the light, and went to bed; and never
again did she sit up late on Hallowe&#8217;en and interfere
with Fairy hours.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">THE BOGGART</h4></div>

<p class="center"><i>From Yorkshire</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time a Boggart lived in a farmer&#8217;s
house. He was a mischievous Elf, and specially
fond of teasing the children. When they were
eating their supper, he would make himself invisible,
and, standing back of their chairs, would
snatch away their bread and butter and drain their
mugs of milk. On cold nights he would pull the
clothes from their warm beds and tickle their feet.</p>

<p>And the children liked to tease the Boggart
in return. There was a closet in the kitchen
with a large knot-hole in its wall behind which
the Boggart lived. The children used to stick a
shoehorn into the hole; and the Boggart would
throw it back at them. The shoehorn made the
little man so angry that one day he threw it at
the youngest boy&#8217;s head and hurt him badly.</p>

<p>At length the Boggart became such a torment
that the farmer and his wife decided to move to
another place and let the mischievous creature
have their house to himself.</p>

<p>The day of the moving came. All the furniture
was piled into a wagon, and a neighbour called to
say good-bye. &#8220;So, farmer,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you are
leaving the old house at last!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>&#8220;Heigh-ho!&#8221; sighed the farmer, &#8220;I am forced
to do it. That villain Boggart torments us so
that we have no rest night or day! He almost
killed my youngest boy. So you see we are forced
to flit.&#8221;</p>

<p>Scarcely were the words out of his mouth when
a squeaky voice cried from the bottom of the
churn, that was in the wagon:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye! Aye! We&#8217;re flitting, you see!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ods! Hang it!&#8221; cried the poor farmer.
&#8220;There is that villain Boggart again! If he&#8217;s
going along with us, I shall not stir a peg. Nay!
Nay! It&#8217;s no use, Molly,&#8221; said he turning to his
wife. &#8220;We may as well stay here in the old house
as to be tormented in the new one that is not so
convenient!&#8221;</p>

<p>And they stayed.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">OWNSELF</h4></div>

<p class="center"><i>From Northumberland</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time there was a widow and her
little boy. Their home was a small cottage in
the wood. The mother worked hard from early
morning until evening, and she was so tired that
she liked to go to bed early. But the little boy
did not like to go to bed early at all.</p>

<p>One evening when his mother told him to undress,
he begged her, saying: &#8220;I&#8217;m not sleepy.
May I sit up just this once?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Sit up if you wish,
but if the Fairies catch you here alone, they will
surely carry you off.&#8221; Then she went to bed.</p>

<p>The little boy laughed, and sat down on the
hearth before the fire, watching the blaze and
warming his hands.</p>

<p>By and by he heard a giggling and a laughing
in the chimney, and the next minute he saw a
tiny girl, as big as a doll, come tumbling down
and jump on to the hearth in front of him.</p>

<p>At first the little boy was dreadfully frightened,
but the tiny girl began to dance so prettily,
and to nod her head at him in such a friendly
way, that he forgot to be afraid.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do they call you, little girl?&#8221; said he.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>&#8220;My name is Ownself,&#8221; said she proudly.
&#8220;What is yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My name,&#8221; he answered, laughing very hard,
&#8220;is My Ownself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the two children began to play together
as if they had known each other all their lives.
They danced, and they sang, and they roasted
chestnuts before the fire, and they tickled the
house-cat&#8217;s ears. Then the fire commenced to
flicker, and it grew dimmer and dimmer; so the
little boy took the poker and stirred up the embers.
And a hot coal tumbled out and rolled on to
Ownself&#8217;s tiny foot. And, oh! how she screamed!
Then she wept, and flew into such a rage that the
little boy got frightened and hid behind the door.</p>

<p>Just then a squeaky voice called down the
chimney: &#8220;Ownself! Ownself! What wicked
creature hurt you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My Ownself! My Ownself!&#8221; she screamed
back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then come here, you troublesome little
Fairy,&#8221; cried the voice angrily.</p>

<p>And a Fairy mother, slipper in hand, came
hurrying down the chimney; and catching Ownself,
she whipped her soundly and carried her
off, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s all this noise about, then? If you did
it your ownself, there&#8217;s nobody to blame but
yourself!&#8221;</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">THE SICK-BED ELVES</h4></div>

<p class="center"><i>From China</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Wang Little-Third-One</span> lay stretched on his
bed of bamboo laths, where a low fever kept him.
He complained to every one, especially to his
friend the Magician who came to see him.</p>

<p>The Magician was very wise, so he gave Wang
a drink of something delicious and cool, and went
away.</p>

<p>When Little-Third-One had drunk this, his
fever fell, and he was able to enjoy a little sleep.
He was awakened by a slight noise. The night was
come. The room was lighted by the full moon,
which threw a bright gleam through the open door.</p>

<p>Then he saw that the room was full of insects
that were moving and flying hither and thither.
There were white ants that gnaw wood, bad-smelling
bugs, enormous cockroaches, mosquitoes,
and many many flies. And they were all
buzzing, gnashing their teeth, or falling.</p>

<p>As Little-Third-One looked, he saw something
move on the threshold. A small man, not bigger than
a thumb, advanced with cautious steps. In his hand
he held a bow; a sword was hanging by his side.</p>

<p>Little-Third-One, looking closer, saw two dogs
as big as shirt-buttons, running in front of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
little man. They suddenly stopped. The archer
approached nearer to the bed, and held out his
bow, and discharged a tiny arrow. A cockroach
that was crawling before the dogs, made a bound,
fell on its back, kicked, and was motionless. The
arrow had run through it.</p>

<p>Behind the little man, other little men had
come. Some rode on small horses, and were armed
with swords, and still others were on foot. All
these huntsmen scattered about the room, and
ran or rode, to and fro, shooting arrows, and
brandishing their swords; until hundreds and
hundreds of insects were killed. At first the
mosquitoes escaped, but, as they cannot fly for
long, every time one of them settled on the wall,
it was transfixed by a huntsman.</p>

<p>Soon none were left of all the insects that had
broken the silence with their buzzing, their gnashing
of teeth, and their falling.</p>

<p>A horseman then galloped around the room,
looking from right to left. He gave a signal. All
the huntsmen called their dogs, went to the door,
and disappeared.</p>

<p>Little-Third-One had not moved, for fear that
he should disturb the hunt. At last he went
peacefully to sleep, and woke the next day cured.
When his friend the Magician came to see him,
Little-Third-One told him about the mysterious
huntsmen, and his friend the Magician smiled.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">HOW PEEPING KATE WAS
PISKEY-LED</h4></div>

<p class="center"><i>From Cornwall</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">&#8217;Tis</span> Hallowe&#8217;en Night, Teddy, my boy. Don&#8217;t
go out on the moor, or near the Gump, for the
Piskeys and the Spriggans are abroad, waiting
to mislead straying mortals. Many are the men
and women that the Little People have whisked
away on Hallowe&#8217;en Night; and the poor mortals
have never been heard of since.</p>

<p>Sit down, Teddy, my boy, crack these nuts,
and eat these red apples; and I&#8217;ll tell you how
Peeping Kate was Piskey-led.</p>

<p>I have heard the old folks say how long ago&mdash;maybe
a hundred years or so&mdash;the Squire of
Pendeen had a housekeeper, an elderly dame,
called Kate Tregeer.</p>

<p>Well, one Hallowe&#8217;en Night, some spices and
other small things were wanted for the feasten-tide,
and Kate would not trust any one to go for
them except herself. So she put on her red coat
and high steeple-crowned hat, and walked to
Penzance. She bought the goods and started for
home.</p>

<p>It was a bright moonlight night, and though
no wind was blowing, the leaves of the trees were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
murmuring with a hollow sound. And Kate could
hear strange rustlings in the bushes by the side
of the road.</p>

<p>She had walked a very long time, and her basket
was so heavy that she began to feel tired.
Her legs bent under her and she could scarcely
stand up. Just then she beheld, a little in front
of her, a man on horseback. And she could tell by
the proud way he sat that he was a gentleman-born.</p>

<p>She was very glad to see him, and as he was
going slowly, she soon overtook him; and when
she came up, his horse stood stock-still.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Master,&#8221; she said, &#8220;how glad I am
to see you. Don&#8217;t you know me? I&#8217;m Kate Tregeer
of Pendeen; and I can&#8217;t tell you how hard
I&#8217;ve worked all day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she explained to him how she had walked
to Penzance, and was now so tired that she could
not stand up. But the gentleman made no reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Master,&#8221; said she, &#8220;I&#8217;m footsore
and leg-weary. I&#8217;ve got as far as here, you see,
but I can get no farther. Do have pity on a poor
unfortunate woman, and take her behind you.
I can ride well enough on your horse&#8217;s back without
a saddle or pillion.&#8221;</p>

<p>But still the gentleman made no reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Master,&#8221; she said again, &#8220;My! but
you&#8217;re a fine-looking man! How upright you sit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
on your horse! But why don&#8217;t you answer me?
Are you asleep? One would think you were taking
a nap; and your horse, too, it is standing so still!&#8221;</p>

<p>Not having any word in reply to this fine
speech, Kate called out as loud as she could:
&#8220;Even if you are a gentleman-born, you needn&#8217;t
be so stuck-up that you won&#8217;t speak to a poor
body afoot!&#8221;</p>

<p>Still he never spoke, though Kate thought that
she saw him wink at her.</p>

<p>This vexed her the more. &#8220;The time was when
the Tregeers were among the first in the parish,
and were buried with the gentry! Wake up and
speak to me!&#8221; screamed she in a rage. And then
she took up a stone, and threw it at the horse.
The stone rolled back to her feet, and the animal
did not even whisk its tail.</p>

<p>Kate now got nearer, and saw that the rider
had no hat on, nor was there any hair on his bald
head. She touched the horse, and felt nothing
but a bunch of furze. She rubbed her eyes and
saw at once, to her great astonishment, that it
was no gentleman and horse at all, only a smooth
stone half buried in a heap of furze. And there
she was still far away from Pendeen, with her
heavy basket, and her legs so tired that she
could scarcely move. And then she saw that she
had come a short distance only, and knew that
she must be bewitched.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>Well, on she went; and seeing a light at her
left hand she thought that it shone from the window
of a house where she might rest awhile. So
she made for it straight across the moor, floundering
through bogs, and tripping over bunches
of furze. And still the light was always just
ahead, and it seemed to move from side to side.
Then suddenly it went out, and she was left
standing in a bog. The next minute she found
herself among furze-ricks and pigsties, in the
yard of Farmer Boslow, miles away from Pendeen.</p>

<p>She opened the door of an old outhouse, and
entered, hoping to get a few hours&#8217; rest. There
she lay down on straw and fell asleep; but she
was soon wakened by some young pigs who were
rooting around in the straw. That was too much
for Kate. So up she got, and as she did so she
heard the noise of a flail. And seeing a glimmer
of light in a barn near by, she crept softly to a
little window in the barn, and peeped to find what
was going on.</p>

<p>At first she could see only two rush-wicks burning
in two old iron lamps. Then through the dim
light she saw the slash-flash of a flail as it rose
and fell, and beat the barn floor. She stood on
tiptoes, and stuck her head in farther, and whom
did she see, wielding the flail, but a little old
man, about three feet high, with hair like a bunch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
of rushes, and ragged clothes. His face was
broader than it was long, and he had great owl-eyes
shaded by heavy eyebrows from which his
nose poked like a pig&#8217;s snout. Kate noticed that
his teeth were crooked and jagged, and that at
each stroke of the flail, he kept moving his thin
lips around and around, and thrusting his tongue
in and out. His shoulders were broad enough
for a man twice his height, and his feet were
splayed like a frog&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well! Well!&#8221; thought Kate. &#8220;This is luck!
To see the Piskey threshing! For ever since I
can remember I have heard it said that the Piskey
threshed corn for Farmer Boslow on winter
nights, and did other odd jobs for him the year
round. But I would not believe it. Yet here he
is!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she reached her head farther in, and beheld
a score of little men helping the Piskey.
Some of them were lugging down the sheaves,
and placing them handy for him; and others
were carrying away the straw from which the
grain had been threshed. Soon a heap of corn
was gathered on the floor, as clean as if it had
been winnowed.</p>

<p>In doing this the Piskey raised such a dust
that it set him and some of the little men sneezing.
And Kate, without stopping to think, called
out:&mdash;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>&#8220;God bless you, little men!&#8221;</p>

<p>Quick as a wink the lights vanished, and a
handful of dust was thrown into her eyes, which
blinded her so that for a moment she could not
see. And then she heard the Piskey squeak:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;<i>I spy thy face,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Old Peeping Kate,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>I&#8217;ll serve thee out,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Early and late!</i>&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Kate, when she heard this, felt very uneasy,
for she remembered that the Little People have
a great spite against any one who peeps at them,
or pries into their doings.</p>

<p>The night being clear, she quickly found her
way out of a crooked lane, and ran as fast as she
could, and never stopped until she reached the
Gump. There she sat down to rest awhile.</p>

<p>After that she stood up; and turn whichever
way she might the same road lay before her.
Then she knew that the Piskey was playing her
a trick. So she ran down a hill as fast as she could,
not caring in what direction she was going, so
long as she could get away from the Piskey.</p>

<p>After running a long while, she heard music
and saw lights at no great distance. Thinking
that she must be near a house, she went over
the downs toward the lights, feeling ready for a
jig, and stopping now and then to dance around
and around to the strains of the music.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>But instead of arriving at a house, in passing
around some high rocks she came out on a broad
green meadow, encircled with furze and rocks.
And there before her she saw a whole troop of
Spriggans holding an Elfin Fair. It was like a
feasten-day. Scores of little booths were standing
in rows, and were covered with tiny trinkets
such as buckles of silver and gold glistening with
Cornish diamonds, pins with jewelled heads,
brooches, rings, bracelets, and necklaces of crystal
beads, green and red or blue and gold; and many
other pretty things new to Kate.</p>

<p>There were lights in all directions&mdash;lanterns
no bigger than Foxgloves were hanging in rows;
and on the booths, rushlights in tulip-cups shone
among Fairy goodies such as Kate had never
dreamed of. Yet with all these lights there was
such a shimmer over everything that she got bewildered,
and could not see as plainly as she wished.</p>

<p>She did not care to disturb the Little People
until she had looked at all that was doing. So
she crept softly behind the booths and watched
the Spriggans dancing. Hundreds of them, linked
hand in hand, went whirling around so fast as
to make her dizzy. Small as they were, they were
all decked out like rich folk, the little men in
cocked hats and feathers, blue coats gay with lace
and gold buttons, breeches and stockings of lighter
hue, and tiny shoes with diamond buckles.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>Kate could not name the colours of the little
ladies&#8217; dresses, which were of all the hues of
Summer blossoms. The vain little things had
powdered their hair, and decked their heads with
ribbons, feathers, and flowers. Their shoes were
of velvet and satin, and were high-heeled and
pointed. And such sparkling black eyes as all
the little ladies had, and such dimpled cheeks
and chins! And they were merry, sprightly, and
laughing.</p>

<p>All the Spriggans were capering and dancing
around a pole wreathed with flowers. The pipers,
standing in their midst, played such lively airs
that Kate never in all her life had wanted to
dance more. But she kept quite still, for she did
not wish the Little People to know that she was
there. She was determined to pocket some of the
pretty things in the booths, and steal softly away
with them. She thought how nice a bright pair
of diamond buckles would look on her best shoes,
and how fine her Sunday cap would be ornamented
with a Fairy brooch.</p>

<p>So she raised her hand and laid it on some
buckles, when&mdash;oh! oh!&mdash;she felt a palmful
of pins and needles stick into her fingers like red-hot
points; and she screamed:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Misfortune take you, you bad little Spriggans!&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_118f.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;SHE SAW A WHOLE TROOP OF SPRIGGANS HOLDING AN
ELFIN FAIR&#8221;</p>

<p>Immediately the lights went out, and she felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
hundreds of the Little People leap on her back,
and her neck, and her head. At the same moment
others tripped up her heels, and laid her flat on
the ground, and rolled her over and over.</p>

<p>Then she caught sight of the Piskey mounted
on a wild-looking colt, his toes stuck in its mane.
He was holding a rush for a whip. And there he
sat grinning from ear to ear, and urging on the
Spriggans to torment her, with &#8220;Haw! Haw!
Haw!&#8221; and &#8220;Tee! Hee! Hee!&#8221;</p>

<p>She spread out her arms and squeezed herself
tight to the ground, so that the Spriggans might
not turn her over; but they squeaked and grunted,
and over and over she went. And every time that
they turned her face downward, some of the
little fellows jumped on her back, and jigged
away from her toe to her head.</p>

<p>She reached around to beat them off with a
stick, but they pulled it out of her hand; and,
balancing it across her body, strided it, and
bobbed up and down, singing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;<i>See-saw-pate!</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Lie still old Peeping Kate!</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>See-saw-pate!</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Here we&#8217;ll ride, early and late,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>On the back of Peeping Kate!</i>&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>And with that, poor Kate, not to be beaten by
the Spriggans, tossed back her feet to kick the
little fellows away, but they pulled off her shoes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
and tickled and prickled the soles of her feet
until she fell a-laughing and a-crying by turns.</p>

<p>Kate was almost mad with their torment,
when by good chance she remembered a charm
that would drive away all mischievous spirits,
on Hallowe&#8217;en. So she repeated it forwards and
backwards, and in a twinkling all the little Spriggans
fled screeching away, the Piskey galloping
after them.</p>

<p>Then she got on her feet and looked around.
She saw, by the starlight of a clear frosty morning,
that the place to which she had been Piskey-led
was a green spot near the Gump, where folks
said the Spriggans held their nightly revels. And
although the spot was very small, it had seemed to
her like a ten-acre field because of enchantment.</p>

<p>And her hat, and her shoes, and her basket
were gone; and poor Kate, barefooted and bareheaded,
had to hobble home as best she could.
And she reached Pendeen gate more dead than
alive.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">ONE-EYED PRYING JOAN&#8217;S TALE</h4></div>

<p class="center"><i>From Cornwall</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Sit</span> down, Bobby, my boy. Eat some bread and
cheese. Don&#8217;t be afraid to drink the cider. It&#8217;s
all my own making. Sit down, and I&#8217;ll tell you
how I lost the sight of my right eye.</p>

<p>The last Christmas Eve I went to Penzance
to buy a pair of shoes for myself, and some thread
and buttons, and things to mend Master&#8217;s clothes.
I dearly like company, and as I started out I
thought of old Betty down at the cove, she that
they say is a Witch, you know.</p>

<p>Thinks I to myself: &#8220;If she&#8217;s a Witch, she&#8217;ll
not hurt me, as I never crossed her in my life.
Witch or no Witch, I&#8217;ll stop and have a bite of
something hot at her little house,&#8221; thought I.</p>

<p>When I came to the house, the door was tight
shut, and I heard a strange mumbling inside, but
I could not make out what it was. So I took a
peep through the latch-hole. And what did I
see but old Betty standing by the chimney-piece
with a little box in her hand, and she was muttering
something that sounded like a charm. She
put her finger into the box and pulled it out again,
and smeared some ointment over her eyes. Then
she put the box into a hole near the chimney.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>I lifted the latch and walked in. &#8220;How-de-do,
Betty,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Welcome,&#8221; said she, grinning and pleased.
&#8220;Sit down by the fire. Now we&#8217;ll have a good
drop of something hot to ourselves, seeing that
it&#8217;s Christmas Eve,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take a thimbleful, just to drink your
health and a Merry Christmas to you, with all
my heart,&#8221; said I; for I well knew that Betty
made the best sweet drink, with sugar and spice
and a roasted apple bobbing around in it.</p>

<p>I put down my basket, and took off my coat,
and sat by the fire; while Betty stepped into a
closet to fetch the cups.</p>

<p>Now, I had often wondered what made her
eyes so clear and piercing. &#8220;&#8217;Tis the Fairy
ointment, or Witch salve in the box,&#8221; thought I.
&#8220;If it will do that to her eyes, it won&#8217;t hurt me.&#8221;
So while she was gone, I took the box from the
hole, where she had covered it with ferns, and
put a bit of the ointment on my right eye. The
stuff had no sooner touched me than it burned
like fire, or as if needles and pins were being
thrust into my eyeball. Just then Betty came
from the closet, and I dragged the brim of my
hat down over my right eye, so she should not
see what had happened.</p>

<p>After we had drunk each other&#8217;s health three
or four times, the pain went off, and I ventured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
to open my anointed eye. And oh! what did I
see! The place was full of Spriggans! Troops of
the Little People were cutting all sorts of capers
in the folds of the nets and sails hung on the
walls, in the bunches of herbs that swung from
the rafters, and in the pots and pans on the
dresser. Some of them were playing seesaw on
the beams of the ceiling, tossing their heels and
waving their feathered caps, as they teetered up
and down on bits of straw or green twigs. Numbers
of them were swinging in the cobwebs that
festooned the rafters or riding mice in and out
through holes in the thatch.</p>

<p>I noted that all the little men were dressed in
green tricked out with red, and had feathered
caps and high riding-boots with silver spurs.
Their ladies, if you please, were all decked in
grand fashion&mdash;their gowns were of green velvet
with long trains and looped up with silver chains
and bells. They wore high-crowned steeple-hats,
with wreaths of the most beautiful flowers around
them; while sprigs of blossoms and garlands decorated
all parts of their dress, and were in their
hands as well. They were the sauciest Little
People I ever did see. They pranced around on
their high-heeled boots sparkling with diamond
buckles.</p>

<p>When I peeped into the wood-corner under
Betty&#8217;s bunk, I spied some of the ugly Spriggans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
sitting there looking very gloomy because they
have to watch the treasures that are hidden in
the ground, and do other disagreeable things that
the merry Spriggans never have to do.</p>

<p>While looking into the dark corner I heard
strains of sweet, unearthly music outside the
house. Glancing around the room, I saw that
all was changed. The walls were hung with tapestry,
the chimney stools on which we sat were
carved chairs. Betty and I sat under a canopy
of embroidered satin, and our feet rested on a
silken carpet. And wherever the little Spriggans
trod, they left circles like diamonds on the floor.</p>

<p>The sweet music was now close at hand under
the little window, and a moment after a troop
of the Little People appeared on the window-sill,
playing on pipes, flutes, and other instruments
made of green reeds from the brook and of shells
from the shore.</p>

<p>The Fairy band stepped down most gracefully
from the window-sill, and was closely followed
by a long train of little men and women magnificently
dressed, and carrying bunches of flowers
in their hands. All walked in an orderly procession,
two by two, and bowed or curtsied, to
Betty, and cast the flowers in her lap. I saw their
many bunches of Four-leaved Clover and sprigs
of magic herbs. With these she makes her salves
and lotions.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>Then all the Spriggans who had been dancing
and capering about the ceiling and floor joined
the others and came crowding around Betty.
She did not look surprised, and I did not say
anything to let her know that I saw. The Spriggans
then began to pour dew over her dress out
of flower-buds and from the bottles of the Foxglove.
Immediately her jacket was changed into
the finest and richest cloth of a soft cream colour,
and her dress became velvet the colour of all the
flowers, and it was draped over a petticoat of silk
quilted with silver cord.</p>

<p>The Little People brought tiny nosegays of
sky-blue Pimpernel, Forget-me-nots, and dainty
flower-bells, blue, pink, and white, and hundreds
of other Fairy blossoms like stars and butterflies.
These delicate little sprigs they stitched all over
Betty&#8217;s silver-corded petticoat together with
branching moss and the lace-like tips of the wild
grass. All around the bottom of her skirt they
made a wreath of tiny bramble leaves with roses
and berries, red and black.</p>

<p>Many of the Little People perched themselves
on the top of the high-backed chair in which
Betty sat, and even stood on her shoulders, so
that they might arrange her every curl and every
hair. Some took the lids off pretty little urns
they carried in their hands, and poured perfume
on her head, which spread the sweetest odours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
through the room. I very much admired the
lovely little urns, with their grooved lids, but when
I picked one up, it was only a seed-pod of the wild
Poppy. They placed no other ornament in her hair
except a small twig of holly full of bright red berries.
Yet Betty, decked out by her Fairy friends, was
more beautiful than the loveliest Queen of May.</p>

<p>My senses were overcome by the smell of the
Fairy odours, and the scent of the flowers, and
the sweet perfume of honey, with which the walls
of the house seemed bursting. And my head fell
forward and I slept.</p>

<p>How long I dozed I do not know, but when I
woke I saw that all the little Spriggans were
glaring at me angrily. They thrust out their
tongues and made the most horrid grimaces. I
was so frightened that I jumped up, and ran out
of the house, and shut the door.</p>

<p>But for the life of me, I could not leave the
place without taking another peep. I put my
left eye to the latch-hole&mdash;and would you believe
it?&mdash;the house was just as it was when I
entered it; the floor was bare, and there sat Betty
in her old clothes before the fire. Then I winked,
and looked with the right eye, and there was
the beautiful room, and Betty seated in her fine
flower-gown, beneath the silken canopy, while
all the little Spriggans were dancing and capering
around her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>I tore myself away, glad to get out of the cove,
and hurried to Penzance to do my shopping, although
it was so late. And as I was standing in
front of a booth, what should I see but a little
Spriggan helping himself to hanks of yarn, stockings,
and all sorts of fine things.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! Ha! my little man!&#8221; cried I. &#8220;Are you
not ashamed to be carrying on this way, stealing
all those goods?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that thee, old Joan?&#8221; said he. &#8220;Which
eye canst thou see me with?&#8221;</p>

<p>After winking both my eyes, I said: &#8220;&#8217;Tis
plain enough that I can see you with my right
eye.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then in a twinkling he pointed his finger at
my right eye, and mumbled a spell, and I just
caught the words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;<i>Joan the Pry</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Shall nor peep nor spy,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>But shall lose</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Her charmèd eye!</i>&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Then he blew in my face, and was gone. And
when I looked around, my right eye was blind.
And from that day to this I have never seen a
blink with my anointed eye.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">THE FAIRY&#8217;S SERVANTS</h4></div>

<p class="center"><i>From the Basque</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time there was a poor woman who
had three daughters.</p>

<p>One day the youngest said: &#8220;Mother, now
that I am old enough, I wish to go out to
service.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mother thought to herself: &#8220;If this one
goes, why, there will be more to eat for the rest
of us,&#8221; so she said: &#8220;Very well, good luck go with
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl set out, and after she had walked a
long way she came to a beautiful city. A handsome
lady met her, and asked:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going, my child?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going out to service,&#8221; replied the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you come with me to my home?&#8221; asked
the lady.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed,&#8221; said the girl, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll try to
serve you faithfully.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lady led her to a large and fine house, and
told her what work she should do that day.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are Fairies,&#8221; said she. &#8220;I must go away
for a short time, but do you work in the kitchen
while I am gone. Dig up the kitchen floor, smash
the pitcher, break the plates. Whip the children,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
throw dirt in their faces, and rumple their hair.&#8221;
Then the lady went away.</p>

<p>The girl, who thought these orders very strange,
began to feed the children. Just then a little dog
came creeping up to her, wagging his tail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bow! Bow! Bow!&#8221; said he. &#8220;I, too, want
something to eat!&#8221;</p>

<p>So the girl gave him a plateful of breakfast,
and when he had eaten all he wished, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a good girl, and I will tell you what
to do to please my mistress. What she really
meant was for you to sweep the kitchen floor,
fill the pitcher, wash the dishes, and dress and feed
the children. Do all this well, and she will give
you the choice of a beautiful star on your forehead
or a donkey&#8217;s tail hanging from your nose.
Then she will offer you a sack of gold or a bag of
charcoal. You must choose the donkey&#8217;s tail and
the bag of charcoal.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, the girl did all as the little dog told her,
and when the mistress came home she smiled and
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Choose which you will have, a beautiful star
on your forehead, or a donkey&#8217;s tail hanging from
your nose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A donkey&#8217;s tail is the same to me,&#8221; said the
girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you have a sack of gold or a bag of charcoal?&#8221;
asked the lady.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>&#8220;The bag of charcoal is the same to me,&#8221; said
the girl.</p>

<p>Then the lady placed a beautiful star on her
forehead, and gave her a big sackful of gold, and
told her she might go back to her mother.</p>

<p>The girl thanked the lady, and leaving the
house hastened home. When her mother and
sisters saw how pretty she was with the star on
her forehead, and when they felt the big sack of
gold on her shoulder, they were astonished.</p>

<p>Then the eldest sister began to cry and say:
&#8220;Mother, I will go out and be a servant,
too!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! no! my child,&#8221; said the mother, &#8220;I will
not let you go.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the girl wept, and would not leave her
mother in peace until she said, &#8220;Go&#8221;; then she
set off and walked until she came to the Fairy
city.</p>

<p>The handsome lady met her and asked:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going, my child?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going out to service,&#8221; said the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you come with me to my home?&#8221; asked
the lady.</p>

<p>The girl said she would, so the lady led her to
the large and fine house and told her what work
she should do that day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dig up the kitchen floor,&#8221; said she, &#8220;smash
the pitcher, break the plates. Whip the children,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
throw dirt in their faces, and rumple their hair.&#8221;
Then she went away.</p>

<p>As soon as the lady was gone, the girl began to
eat up all the good things in the pantry. Just
then the little dog came creeping up to her, wagging
his tail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bow! Bow! Bow! I, too, want something
to eat,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go away, you horrid little beast,&#8221; answered
the girl, and she gave him a kick.</p>

<p>But the little dog would not leave her, and followed
her about until she drove him from the
kitchen with blows. Then she dug up the kitchen
floor, smashed the pitcher, broke all the plates,
whipped the children, threw dirt in their faces,
and rumpled their hair.</p>

<p>By and by the mistress came home, and when
she saw what the girl had been doing she frowned
and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Choose which you will have, a beautiful star
on your forehead or a donkey&#8217;s tail hanging from
your nose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A star on my forehead for me,&#8221; said the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you have a sack of gold or a bag of charcoal?&#8221;
asked the lady.</p>

<p>&#8220;A sack of gold for me,&#8221; said the girl.</p>

<p>Then the lady hung a donkey&#8217;s tail on the end
of her nose, and gave her a big bag of charcoal,
and sent her back to her home. And when her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
mother saw her she was so ashamed that she
locked her in the cellar.</p>

<p>As for the youngest girl, she shared her sack
of gold with her mother and other sister, and then
she married a fine young man, and lived happily
ever after.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">THE PIXIES</h4></div>

<p class="center"><i>From England</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was once a little cottage in the middle
of a flower garden. Its walls were covered with
roses, and its porch was twined with clematis.
The bees buzzed over the flowers, and the butterflies
fluttered about the porch. And a hundred
little green Pixies lived in the wood near by.</p>

<p>In this cottage two orphan sisters dwelt all
alone. One morning the elder sister, Mary, got
up at break of day. She milked the cow, churned
the butter, swept the hearth, and made the
breakfast. Then she sat on the porch to spin,
and sang:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;<i>How merrily the wheel goes round,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>With a whirring, humming sound!</i>&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>But the younger sister, Alice, lay in bed asleep.
Then Mary put her spinning aside, and called:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wake, Alice, wake! There is much for you
to do while I go to the market-town. I must sell
our yarn, and buy your new dress. While I am
gone, don&#8217;t forget to bring in the firewood, drain
the honeycomb, and fill the Pixies&#8217; water-pail.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Alice did not answer. So Mary put on her
hood and took her basket full of yarn. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
walked all the way to the market-town and sold
her yarn, and bought the new dress. Then she
walked home again.</p>

<p>The sun was set when she reached the cottage,
and Alice was sitting idle on the porch. The
honeycomb was not drained, the firewood was
not brought in, the bed was not made, and the
supper was uncooked. And although Mary was
tired and hungry, she had to cook the supper and
make the bed. Then the sisters went to sleep.</p>

<p>By and by, the hundred little green Pixies
came creeping, creeping into the kitchen. They
pattered softly about and whispered so that the
sisters should not hear them. Some ran to the
spinning-wheel and began to spin, others built a
fire under the oven, and mixed and kneaded the
bread. One took a broom and swept the floor,
and another brought in the firewood.</p>

<p>When all the yarn was spun, the bread baked,
and the kitchen tidy, the Pixies ran to the water-pail
to get a drink. But there was not a drop of
water in it! And, oh! how angry they were!</p>

<p>Then Mary awoke, and cried: &#8220;Alice! Alice!
Don&#8217;t you hear those angry buzzings? Surely
you did not forget to fill the Pixies&#8217; water-pail!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Alice answered: &#8220;I did not draw the water
to-day. And I will not leave my bed now to fetch
it for any little Pixy!&#8221; Then she went to sleep
again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>But Mary got up, and, though her feet were
tired and sore, she took the pail and ran through
the garden to the spring. And as she stooped she
saw a hundred little faces laughing at her from
the water. She dipped her pail, and they were
gone. She lifted the full pail, and felt little hands
seize it and bear it along. It was carried to the
door, and into the kitchen, and set down by the
hearth. But she could see no one, so she went to
bed again.</p>

<p>The next morning early, Mary got up. She
ran to the pail and looked into it. Then she
clapped her hands and called:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Alice, come! See the silver pennies
shining at the bottom of the clear water! There
must be a hundred of them! Come, sister, dear!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Alice, waking, tried to sit up. But she
screamed with fright, for she could not move her
hands and feet. Indeed, she could not rise at all!
And that day, and the next, and for many days
after, she lay helpless on her bed, and Mary fed
and comforted her.</p>

<p>And every night the hundred little green Pixies
came creeping, creeping into the kitchen. They
swept, they baked, they sewed, they spun, and
they drank from Mary&#8217;s water-pail. And every
night they left one piece of silver there.</p>

<p>And so a whole year passed, and Alice lay and
thought, and thought, and thought about her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
idle ways. And one night she called Mary to her,
and wept and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, sister, if only I could get up to-morrow,
and feel the warm sunshine and play among the
flowers! And if only I were strong enough to work
for you, as you have worked for me!&#8221;</p>

<p>And Mary kissed and comforted her.</p>

<p>The next morning came, and Mary got up at
break of day. She ran and looked into the water-pail.
Then she clapped her hands and called:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Alice, come! See the silver pennies
shining at the bottom of the clear water! There
must be a hundred of them! Come, sister, dear!&#8221;</p>

<p>And Alice forgot that she could not move.
She sprang lightly out of bed and ran into the
kitchen. And she was all well and happy again!</p>

<p>And oh, how glad the sisters were! How they
kissed each other and laughed with joy! They
milked the cow, and churned, and baked, and
cooked, and sat spinning on the porch. And the
bees buzzed, and the butterflies fluttered, and
the sisters sang:&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">THE BROWNIE OF BLEDNOCH</h4></div>

<p class="center"><i>From Scotland</i></p>


<h5>OLD MADGE&#8217;S TALE</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Have</span> you ever heard of the Brownie, Aiken-Drum?
No? Well, I will tell you how he came
to Blednoch. It was in the Autumn time. The
red sun was setting, when through our town he
passed crying, oh! so wearily:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;<i>Have ye work for Aiken-Drum?</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Have ye work for Aiken-Drum?</i>&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>He tirled at the pin, and entered in. I trow
the boldest there stood back! You should have
heard the children scream. The black dog barked,
the lasses shrieked, at the sight of Aiken-Drum.</p>

<p>His matted head lay on his breast. A long blue
beard fell to his waist. Around his hairy form
was wrapped a cloth of woven rushes green. His
long, thin arms trailed on the ground. His hands
were claws; his feet had no toes. Oh, fearful to
see was Aiken-Drum! And all the time he cried
so wearily, so drearily:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;<i>Have ye work for Aiken-Drum?</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Have ye work for Aiken-Drum?</i>&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Then the brave goodman stood forth, and
said: &#8220;What would you? Whence come you by
land or sea?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>Then what a groan gave Aiken-Drum! &#8220;I
come from a land where I never saw the sky!
But now I&#8217;ll bide with you, if ye have work for
Aiken-Drum! I&#8217;ll watch your sheep and tend
your kine, each night till day. I&#8217;ll thresh your
grain by the light of the moon. I&#8217;ll sing strange
songs to your bonny bairns, if ye&#8217;ll but keep poor
Aiken-Drum! I&#8217;ll churn the cream, I&#8217;ll knead
the bread, I&#8217;ll tame the wildest colts ye have, if
ye&#8217;ll but keep poor Aiken-Drum! No clothes
nor gold is wage for me. A bowl of porridge on
the warm hearthstone is wage enough for Aiken-Drum!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Brownie speaks well,&#8221; said the old housewife.
&#8220;Our workers are scarce. We have much
to do. Let us try this Aiken-Drum.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then should you have seen the Brownie work!
By night he swept the kitchen clean. He scoured
the pots until they shone. By the light of the
moon he threshed the grain. He gathered the
crops into the barn. He watched the sheep
and tended the kine. By day he played with
the bonny bairns, and sang them strange songs
of the land without sky. So passed the months
away, and all farm-things throve for the goodman
and the old housewife.</p>

<p>But when the cold night winds blew hard, a
lass, who saw the Brownie&#8217;s clothes woven all of
rushes green, made him a suit of sheep&#8217;s wool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
warm. She placed it by his porridge bowl. And
that night was heard a wailing cry, so weary and
so dreary:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;<i>Long, long may I now weep and groan!</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Wages of clothes are now my own!</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>O luckless Aiken-Drum!</i>&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>And down the street and through the town,
his voice came back upon the wind:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;<i>Farewell to Blednoch!</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Farewell! Farewell!</i>&#8221;</div>

<h4 class="nobreak">ELSA AND THE TEN ELVES</h4></div>

<p class="center"><i>From Sweden</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time a little girl named Elsa lived
on a farm. She was pretty, sweet-tempered, and
generous, but she did not like to work. Her
father was very proud of her, and sent her to
school in the city. She learned to read, write,
sing, and dance, but still she did not know how to
cook, sew, or care for a house.</p>

<p>When she grew older, she was so good and beautiful
that many young men wished her for a wife,
but she said &#8220;No&#8221; to all except to her neighbour,
Gunner, a handsome, industrious young farmer.
Soon they were married, and went to live on his
farm.</p>

<p>At first all was happiness, but as the days
passed, and Elsa did not direct the servants or
look after the house, everything went wrong.
The storerooms were in disorder, the food was
stolen, and the house dirty. Poor Gunner was at
his wits&#8217; end; he loved Elsa too much to scold her.</p>

<p>The day before Christmas came, the sun had
been up for a long time, and still Elsa lay in bed.
A servant ran into her room, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear mistress, shall we get ready the men&#8217;s
luncheon so that they may go to the woods?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>&#8220;Leave the room,&#8221; said Elsa sleepily, &#8220;and do
not waken me again!&#8221;</p>

<p>Another servant came running in. &#8220;Dear mistress,&#8221;
she cried, &#8220;the leaven is working, and if
you come quickly the bread will be better than
usual.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want candlewicks, dear mistress,&#8221; called a
third.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what meat shall we roast for to-morrow&#8217;s
feast?&#8221; shouted a fourth.</p>

<p>And so it was; servant after servant came running
into the room asking for orders, but Elsa
would neither answer nor get up.</p>

<p>Last of all came Gunner, impatient because his
men had not yet started for the woods.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Elsa,&#8221; he said gently, &#8220;my mother used
to prepare things the night before, so that the
servants might begin work early. We are now
going to the woods, and shall not be back until
night. Remember there are a few yards of cloth
on the loom waiting to be woven.&#8221; Then Gunner
went away.</p>

<p>As soon as he was gone, Elsa got up in a rage,
and, dressing herself, ran through the kitchen to
the little house where the loom was kept. She
slammed the door behind her, and threw herself
down on a couch.</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; she screamed. &#8220;I won&#8217;t!&mdash;I won&#8217;t
endure this drudgery any more! Who would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
have thought that Gunner would make a servant
of me, and wear my life out with work? Oh, me!
Oh, me! Is there no one from far or near to help
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can,&#8221; said a deep voice.</p>

<p>And Elsa, raising her head with fright, saw
standing close to her an old man wrapped in a
gray cloak and wearing a broad-brimmed hat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Old Man Hoberg,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and have
served your family for many generations. You,
my child, are unhappy because you are idle. To
love work is a joy. I will now give you ten obedient
servants who shall do all your tasks for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shook his cloak, and out of its folds tumbled
ten funny little men. They capered and
pranced about, making faces. Then they swiftly
put the room in order and finished weaving the
cloth on the loom. After all was done they ran
and stood in an obedient row before Elsa.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear child, reach hither your hands,&#8221; said
the old man.</p>

<p>And Elsa, trembling, gave him the tips of her
fingers.</p>

<p>Then he said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;<i>Hop-o&#8217;-My-Thumb,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Lick-the-Pot,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Long-Pole,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Heart-in-Hand,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Little-Peter-Funny-Man,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Away all of you to your places!</i>&#8221;</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>And in the twinkling of an eye the little men
vanished into Elsa&#8217;s fingers, and the old man disappeared.</p>

<p>Elsa could hardly believe what had happened,
and sat staring at her hands. Suddenly a wonderful
desire to work came over her. She could
sit still no longer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why am I idling here?&#8221; cried she cheerfully.
&#8220;It is late in the morning and the house is not
in order! The servants are waiting.&#8221; And up she
jumped and hastened into the kitchen, and was
soon giving orders and singing while she prepared
the dinner.</p>

<p>And when Gunner came home that night all
was clean and bright to welcome him, and the
smell of good things to eat filled the house.</p>

<p>And after that day Elsa rose early each morning,
and went about her work sweet-tempered
and happy. No one was more pleased and proud
than she to see how the work of the farmhouse
prospered under her hands. And health, wealth,
and happiness came and stayed with Elsa and
Gunner.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">PISKEY FINE! AND PISKEY GAY!</h4></div>

<p class="center"><i>From Cornwall</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">&#8217;Tis</span> told in the west country, how the Piskey
threshed the corn, and did other odd jobs for
Farmer Boslow as long as the old man lived. And
after his death the Piskey worked for his widow.
And this is how she lost the little fellow.</p>

<p>One night, when the hills were covered with
snow, and the wind was blowing hard, the Widow
Boslow left in the barn, for the Piskey, a larger
bowl than usual full of milk thickened with oatmeal.
It was clear moonlight, and she stopped
outside the door, and peeped in to see if the Piskey
would come to eat his supper while it was
hot.</p>

<p>The moonlight shone through a little window
on to the barn floor; and there, sitting on a sheaf
of oats, she saw the Piskey greedily eating his
thickened milk. He soon emptied the bowl and
scraped it as clean with the wooden spoon as if
it had been washed. Then he placed them both
in a corner, and stood up and patted and stroked
his stomach, and smacked his lips, as if to say:
&#8220;That&#8217;s good of the old dear! See if I don&#8217;t
thresh well for her to-night!&#8221;</p>

<p>But when the Piskey turned around, the widow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
saw that he had nothing on but rags, and very
few of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;How the poor Piskey must suffer!&#8221; thought
she. &#8220;He has to pass most of his time out among
the rushes in the boggy moor, and his legs are
naked, and his breeches are full of holes. I&#8217;ll
make the poor fellow a good warm suit of home-spun,
at once!&#8221;</p>

<p>No sooner thought than she went home and
began the suit. In a day or two she had made a
coat and breeches, and knitted a long pair of
sheep&#8217;s wool stockings, with garters and a nightcap
all nicely knitted, too.</p>

<p>When night came, the widow placed the Piskey&#8217;s
new clothes and a big bowl of thickened
milk on the barn floor, just where the moonlight
fell brightest. Then she went outside, and
peeped through the door.</p>

<p>Soon she saw the Piskey eating his supper, and
squinting at the new clothes. Laying down his
empty bowl, he took the things, and put them
on over his rags. Then he began capering and
jumping around the barn, singing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;<i>Piskey fine! and Piskey gay!</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Piskey now will run away!</i>&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>And sure enough, he bolted out of the door,
and passed the widow, without so much as &#8220;I
wish you well till I see you again!&#8221; And he never
came back to the farm.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">THE FAIRY WEDDING</h4></div>

<p class="center"><i>From Sweden</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time there was a lovely young girl,
daughter of rich parents, who was known for her
gentleness and goodness.</p>

<p>One night, while she was lying awake in her
bed, watching the moonbeams dance on the floor,
her door was softly opened. Then in tripped a
little Fairy man clad in a gray jacket and red cap.
He came lightly toward her bed, nodding in a
most friendly way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not be afraid, dear lady,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
have come to ask a favour of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I will do it willingly, if I can,&#8221; answered
the girl, who had begun to recover from her
fright.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it will not be difficult!&#8221; said the Fairy
man. &#8220;For many years I and mine have lived
under the floor of your kitchen, just where the
water-cask stands. But the cask has become
old and leaky, so that we are continually annoyed
by the dripping of water. Our home is
never dry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That shall be seen to in the morning,&#8221; said
the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, dear lady,&#8221; said the Fairy man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
and making an elegant bow, he disappeared as
softly as he had come.</p>

<p>The next day, at the girl&#8217;s request, her parents
had the water-cask removed. And after that,
to the surprise of the servants, the kitchen-work
was done at night when all slept, and never a
pitcher or glass was broken in the house from that
day forth. So the Fairies showed their gratitude.</p>

<p>Well, a few months after this, the pretty young
girl was again lying awake in her bed, watching
the moonbeams dance on the floor, when again
her door was opened softly, and the Fairy man
stole in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear lady,&#8221; said he, smiling and bowing,
&#8220;now I have another request to make, which, in
your kindness, you will surely not refuse to grant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked she.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you honour me and my house, to-night,&#8221;
he replied, &#8220;and stand at the christening of my
newly born daughter?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl arose and dressing herself, followed
the Fairy man through many passages and rooms
that she had never known existed. At last they
entered a small but elegant apartment, in which
a host of Fairies were assembled. They immediately
christened the Fairy baby. And as the
little man was about to conduct the girl again
to her room, the Fairies filled her pockets with
what looked like shavings.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>The little man then led her back through the
same winding passages, and as soon as she was
safely in her room, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;If we should meet at another time, you must
never laugh at me and mine. We love you for
your goodness and modesty, but if you laugh at
us, you and I shall never see each other again.&#8221;</p>

<p>When he was gone the girl threw all the shavings
into the fireplace, and lay down, and went
to sleep. And, lo, the next morning when the
maid came in to build the fire, she found in the
ashes the most beautiful jewelry, all of pure gold
set with gems, and of the finest workmanship!</p>

<p>Now, it happened, some time after this, that
the girl&#8217;s wedding day arrived. There was great
bustling, and preparations for a splendid feast.
At length the wedding hour came. The bride,
beautifully dressed and wearing her Fairy jewels
and a crown on her golden hair, was conducted
to the hall where the guests were waiting.</p>

<p>During the ceremony she chanced to glance
around the hall. She saw, near the fireplace, all
her friends the Fairies gathered for a wedding
feast. The bridegroom was a little Elf, and the
bride was her goddaughter, and the feast was
spread on a golden table.</p>

<p>No one but the girl could see the Fairies. Just
at that moment one of the Elves, who was acting
as waiter at the Fairy bridal, stumbled over a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
twig that lay on the floor, and fell. Forgetting
the caution that the little man had given her, the
girl burst into a hearty laugh.</p>

<p>Instantly the golden table, the Elfin bridegroom
and bride, and all the Fairy guests vanished.
And from that day to this, no work was
ever done at night in that kitchen, nor were any
Fairies ever seen about that house.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">THE TOMTS</h4></div>

<p class="center"><i>From Sweden</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Every</span> child knows&mdash;or ought to know if he
does not know&mdash;that the Tomt is a queer little
Elfin man, old and wizen, and clad in gray clothes
and red cap. He lives in the pantry or in the barn.
At night he washes the dishes and sweeps the
kitchen floor, or threshes the farmer&#8217;s corn and
looks after his sheep. Oh, the Tomt is a very
friendly Elf, but his feelings are easily hurt! And
if any one is impolite to him, he runs away, and
is never seen again.</p>

<p>Now, it happened, once upon a time, that there
was a farmer whose crops and flocks and herds
prospered so well that all knew he was aided by
a Tomt. In fact he became the richest farmer in
his neighbourhood. Although he had few servants,
his house was always in order, and his
grain nicely threshed. But he never saw the Elf
who did all these things for him.</p>

<p>One night he decided to watch and see who
worked in his barn. He hid behind a door. By
and by he saw, not <i>one</i> Tomt, but a <i>multitude</i>
of Tomts come into the barn. Each carried a
stalk of rye; but the littlest Tomt of all, not
bigger than a thumb, puffed and breathed very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
hard, although he carried but a straw on his
shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you puff so hard?&#8221; cried the farmer
from his hiding-place. &#8220;Your burden is not so
great!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His burden is according to his strength, for
he is but one night old,&#8221; answered one of the
Tomts. &#8220;Hereafter you shall have less!&#8221;</p>

<p>And with that all the little men vanished, and
the grain lay unthreshed on the barn floor.</p>

<p>And from that day all luck disappeared from
the farmer&#8217;s house, and he was soon reduced to
beggary.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">KINTARO THE GOLDEN BOY</h4></div>

<p class="center"><i>From Japan</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time a poor widow and her little
boy lived in a cave in the midst of a great forest.
The little one&#8217;s name was Kintaro the Golden
Boy. He was a sturdy fellow with red cheeks and
laughing eyes. He was different from other boys.
When he fell down, he sang cheerily; if he wandered
away from the cave, he could always find
his way home again; and while he was yet very
small, he could swing a heavy axe in circles round
his head.</p>

<p>Kintaro grew to be ten years old, and a handsome,
manly lad he was. Then his mother looked
at him often and sighed deeply. &#8220;Must my child
grow up in this lonely forest!&#8221; thought she sadly.
&#8220;Will he never take his place in the world of
men! Alas! Alas!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Kintaro was perfectly happy. The forest
was full of his playmates. Every living thing
loved him. When he lay on his bed of ferns, the
birds flew nestling to his shoulder, and peeped
into his eyes. The butterflies and moths settled
on his face, and trod softly over his brown body.
But his truest friends were the bears that dwelt
in the forest. When he was tired of walking, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
mother-bear carried him on her back. Her cubs
ran to greet him, and romped and wrestled with
him. Sometimes Kintaro would climb up the
smooth-barked monkey-tree, and sit on the topmost
bough, and laugh at the vain efforts of his
shaggy cub-friends to follow him. Then came
the bears&#8217; supper-time, and the feast of golden
liquid honey!</p>

<p>Now, it happened, one Summer, that there
was to be a great day of sports for the forest
creatures. Soon after dawn, a gentle-eyed stag
came to waken Kintaro. The boy, with a farewell
kiss to his mother, and a caress to the stag,
leaped on his friend&#8217;s back, and wound his arms
around his soft neck. And away they went with
long, noiseless bounds through the forest.</p>

<p>Up hill, across valleys, through thickets they
bounded, until they reached a leafy spot in a
wide, green glade near a foaming cataract. There
the stag set Kintaro down; and the boy seated
himself on a mossy stone, and began to whistle
sweetly.</p>

<p>Immediately the forest rustled with living
things. The song-birds came swiftly to his call.
The eagle and the hawk flew from distant heights.
The crane and the heron stepped proudly from
their hyacinth-pools and hastened to the glade.
All Kintaro&#8217;s feathered friends flocked thither
and rested in the cedar branches. Then through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
the undergrowth came running the wolf, the bear,
the badger, the fox, and the martin, and seated
themselves around Kintaro.</p>

<p>They all began to speak to him. He listened
as they told their joys and sorrows, and he spoke
graciously to each. For Kintaro had learned the
languages of beasts, birds, and flowers.</p>

<p>And who had taught Kintaro all this? The
Tengus, the Wood-Elves. And even while he was
listening to the forest creatures, the Tengus
themselves came tumbling out of the trees, or
popping up from behind stones. Very strange
little Elves they were! Each had the body of a
man, the head of a hawk, powerful claws, and a
long, long nose that usually trailed on the ground.
And every little Tengu wore on his feet tiny stilt-like
clogs.</p>

<p>All these queer Wood-Elves came toward
Kintaro, walking very proudly with their arms
crossed, heads well thrown back, and long noses
held erect in the air. At their head was the Chief
Tengu, very old, with a gray beard and a sharp
beak.</p>

<p>The Chief Tengu seated himself beside Kintaro
on the mossy stone, and waved a seven-feathered
fan in the air. Immediately the sports
began.</p>

<p>The young Tengus were fond of games. They
found their long noses most useful. They now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
fenced with them, and balanced bowls full of
goldfish on them. Then two of the Tengus
straightened their noses, and joined them together,
and so made a tight rope. On this a young
Tengu, with a paper umbrella in one hand, and
leading a little dog with the other, danced and
jumped through a hoop. And all the time an old
Tengu sang a dance-song, and another Tengu
beat time with a fan.</p>

<p>Kintaro cheered loudly, and clapped his hands;
and the beasts and birds barked, hissed, growled,
or sang for pleasure. So the morning passed
swiftly and delightfully, and the time came for
the forest animals to take part in the sports.
They did so running, leaping, tumbling, and flying.</p>

<p>Last of all stood up a great father-bear to
wrestle with Kintaro. Now, the boy had been
taught to fight by his friends the Tengus; and he
had learned from them many skilful tricks. So
he and the bear gripped each other, and began
to wrestle very hard. The bear was powerful
and strong, and his claws like iron, but Kintaro
was not afraid. Backward and forward they
swayed, and struggled, while the Tengus and the
forest creatures sat watching.</p>

<p>Now, it happened that the great Hero Raiko
was just returning from slaying many horrible
ogres and hags. His way lay through the forest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
and at that moment he heard the noise of
the wrestling. He stopped his horse and peered
through the trees into the glade. There he saw
the circle of animals and little Tengus, and Kintaro
struggling with the powerful bear. Just at
that moment the boy, with a skilful movement,
threw the clumsy creature to the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must have that boy for my son,&#8221; thought
Raiko. &#8220;He will make a great hero! He must
be mine!&#8221;</p>

<p>So he waited until Kintaro had mounted the
stag and bounded away through the forest. Then
Raiko followed him on his swift steed to the cave.</p>

<p>When Kintaro&#8217;s mother learned that Raiko
was the mighty warrior who had slain the ogres
and hags, she let him take her son to his castle.
But before Kintaro went, he called together all
his friends, the Tengus, the birds, and the beasts,
and bade them farewell, in words that they remember
to this day.</p>

<p>His mother did not follow her son to the land
of men, for she loved the forest best; but Kintaro,
when he became a great hero, often came
to see her in her home. And all the people of
Japan called him &#8220;Kintaro the Golden Boy.&#8221;</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">THE FLOWER FAIRIES</h4></div>

<p class="center"><i>From China</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time, high on a mountain-side, there
was a place where many beautiful flowers grew,
mostly Peonies and Camellias. A young man
named Hwang, who wished to study all alone,
built himself a little house near by.</p>

<p>One day he noticed from his window a lovely
young girl dressed in white, wandering about
among the flowers. He hastened out of the house
to see who she was, but she ran behind a tall
white Peony, and vanished.</p>

<p>Hwang was very much astonished, and sat
down to watch. Soon the girl slipped from behind
the white Peony, bringing another girl with
her who was dressed in red. They wandered
about hand in hand until they came near Hwang,
when the girl in red gave a scream, and together
the two ran back among the flowers, their robes
and long sleeves fluttering in the wind and scenting
all the air. Hwang dashed after them, but
they had vanished completely.</p>

<p>That evening, as Hwang was sitting over his
books, he was astonished to see the white girl
walk into his little room. With tears in her eyes
she seemed to be pleading with him to help her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
Hwang tried to comfort her, but she did not
speak. Then, sobbing bitterly, she suddenly
vanished.</p>

<p>This appeared to Hwang as very strange. However,
the next day a visitor came to the mountain,
who, after wandering among the flowers, dug up
the tall white Peony, and carried it off. Hwang
then knew that the white girl was a Flower
Fairy; and he became very sad because he had
permitted the Peony to be carried away. Later
he heard that the flower had lived only a few
days. At this he wept, and, going to the place
where the Peony had stood, watered the spot
with his tears.</p>

<p>While he was weeping, the girl in red suddenly
stood before him, wringing her hands, and wiping
her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alas!&#8221; cried she, &#8220;that my dear sister should
have been torn from my side! But the tears,
Hwang, that you have shed, may be the means of
restoring her to us!&#8221;</p>

<p>Having said this, the red girl disappeared. But
that very night Hwang dreamed that she came
to him, and seemed to implore him to help her,
just as the white girl had done. In the morning
he found that a new house was to be erected close
by, and that the builder had given orders to cut
down a beautiful tall red Camellia.</p>

<p>Hwang prevented the destruction of the flower;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
and that same evening, as he sat watching the
Camellia, from behind its tall stem came the white
girl herself, hand in hand with her red sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hwang,&#8221; said the red girl, &#8220;the King of the
Flower Fairies, touched by your tears, has restored
my white sister to us. But as she is now
only the ghost of a flower, she must dwell forever
in a white Peony, and you will never see her
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>At these words Hwang caught hold of the
white girl&#8217;s hand, but it melted away in his; and
both the sisters vanished forever from his sight.
In despair he looked wildly around him, and all
that he saw was a tall white Peony and a beautiful
red Camellia.</p>

<p>After that Hwang pined, and fell ill, and died.
He was buried at his own request, by the side of
the white Peony; and before very long another
white Peony grew up very straight and tall on
Hwang&#8217;s grave; so that the two flowers stood
lovingly side by side.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">THE FAIRY ISLAND</h4></div>

<p class="center"><i>From Cornwall</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> ancient days, in the land of Wales, there was
a blue lake on a high mountain. No one had
ever seen a bird fly near it. And over its waves
came faint strains of delicious music, that seemed
to float from a dimly seen island in its centre.
No one had ever ventured to sail on its water,
for every one knew that it was the abode of the
Tylwyth Teg, the Water Fairies.</p>

<p>It happened, one lovely Summer day, that a
hunter was wandering along the margin of the
lake, and found himself before an open door in a
rock. He entered, and walked along a dark passage
that led downward. He followed this for
some time, and suddenly found himself passing
through another door, that opened on the mysterious,
lovely island, the home of the Tylwyth
Teg.</p>

<p>All around him was a most enchanting garden,
where grew every sort of delicious fruit and fragrant
flower. The next moment a number of
Fairies advanced toward him, and graciously welcomed
him to their abode. They bade him eat as
much fruit as he wished, and pick the flowers, but
told him not to take anything away with him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>All day he remained on the island, listening to
the most ravishing music, and feasting and dancing
with the Fairies.</p>

<p>When it came time for him to leave, he hid a
flower in his bosom, for he wished to show it to
his friends at home. He then said farewell to the
Fairies, and returned through the dark passage
to the margin of the lake. But when he put his
hand in his bosom to pull out the flower, he found
to his amazement that it had vanished. At the
same moment he fell insensible to the ground.</p>

<p>When he came to himself, the door in the rock
had disappeared. And though he searched day
after day, he never again found the passage to
the Fairy Island.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">THE FOUR-LEAVED CLOVER</h4></div>

<p class="center"><i>From Cornwall</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> years ago, in Cornwall, there was a farmer
who owned a fine red cow, named Rosy. She
gave twice as much milk as any ordinary cow.
Even in Winter, when other cows were reduced
to skin and bone, Rosy kept in good condition,
and yielded richer milk than ever.</p>

<p>One Spring, Rosy continued to give plenty of
milk every morning, but at night, when Molly
the maid tried to milk her, she kicked the bucket
over and galloped away across the field. This
happened night after night, and such behaviour
was so strange, that Dame Pendar, the farmer&#8217;s
wife, decided to see what she could do. But no
sooner did she try to milk Rosy than the cow put
up her foot, kicked the bucket to bits, and raced
away, bellowing, tail-on-end.</p>

<p>During this Spring the farmer&#8217;s cattle and
fields thrived wonderfully. And so things continued
until May Day. Now, on May Day night,
when Molly attempted, as usual, to milk Rosy,
she was surprised to see the cow stand quietly
and to hear her begin to moo gently; and, more
wonderful still, the pail was soon full of foaming
new milk. Molly rose from her stool, and, pulling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
a handful of grass, rolled it into a pad, and
tucked it in her hat, so that she might the more
easily carry the bucket on her head.</p>

<p>She put the hat on again, when what was her
amazement to see whole swarms of little Fairies
running around Rosy, while others were on her
back, neck, and head, and still others were under
her, holding up clover blossoms and buttercups
in which to catch the streams of milk that flowed
from her udder. The little Fairies moved around
so swiftly that Molly&#8217;s head grew dizzy as she
watched them. Rosy seemed pleased. She tried
to lick the Little People. They tickled her behind
the horns, ran up and down her back, smoothing
each hair or chasing away the flies. And after
all the Fairies had drunk their fill, they brought
armfuls of clover and grass to Rosy; and she ate
it all, and lowed for more.</p>

<p>Molly stood with her bucket on her head, like
one spell-bound, watching the Little People; and
she would have continued to stand there, but
Dame Pendar, the farmer&#8217;s wife, called her
loudly to know why she had not brought the milk,
if there was any.</p>

<p>At the first sound of Dame Pendar&#8217;s voice, all
the Fairies pointed their fingers at Molly, and
made such wry faces that she was frightened almost
to death. Then&mdash;<i>whisk!</i> and they were
gone!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>Molly hurried to the house, and told her mistress,
and her master, too, all that she had seen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely,&#8221; said Dame Pendar, &#8220;you must have
a Four-leaved Clover somewhere about you. Give
me the wad of grass in your hat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Molly took it out, and gave it to her; and sure
enough there was the Four-leaved Clover which
had opened Molly&#8217;s eyes on that May Day.</p>

<p>As for Rosy, she kicked up her heels, and, bellowing
like mad, galloped away. Over meadows
and moors she went racing and roaring, and was
never seen again.</p>

was Summer time, and the air was warm. She

<p>&#8220;Why are you crying, little girl?&#8221; said a voice
behind her.</p>

<p>Jessie looked around, and saw a pretty little
man dressed in moss and green leaves. His eyes
were dark as dark, and his hair was black as black,
and his mouth was large and showed a hundred
white teeth as small as seed pearls. He was smiling
merrily, and his cream-yellow cheeks were dimpled,
and his eyes soft and kindly. Indeed, he seemed
so friendly that Jessie quite forgot to be afraid.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why are you crying, little girl?&#8221; he asked
again. &#8220;Your tear-drops are falling like dew on
the blue flowers at your feet!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve lost my way,&#8221; sobbed Jessie, &#8220;and the
night is coming on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not cry, little girl,&#8221; said he gently. &#8220;I will
lead you through the wood. I know every path&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
rabbit&#8217;s path, the hare&#8217;s path, the fox&#8217;s
path, the goat&#8217;s path, the path of the deer, and
the path of men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you! Thank you!&#8221; exclaimed
Jessie, as she looked the tiny man up and down,
and wondered to see his strange clothes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do you dwell, little girl?&#8221; asked he.</p>

<p>So Jessie told him, and he said: &#8220;You have
been walking every way but the right way. Follow
me, and you&#8217;ll reach home before the stars
come out to peep at us through the trees.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he turned around, and began to trip
lightly in front of her, and she followed on. He
went so fast that she feared she might lose sight of
him, but he turned around again and again and
smiled and beckoned. And when he saw that she
was still far behind, he danced and twirled about
until she came up. Then he scampered on as before.</p>

<p>At length Jessie reached the edge of the wood,
and, oh, joy! there was her father&#8217;s house beside
the blue lake. Then the little man, smiling, bade
her good-bye.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have I not led you well?&#8221; said he. &#8220;Do not
forget me. I am the Gillie Dhu from Fairyland.
I love little girls and boys. If you are ever lost
in the wood again, I will come and help you!
Good-bye, little girl! Good-bye!&#8221;</p>

<p>And laughing merrily, he trotted away, and
was soon lost to sight among the trees.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">HOW KAHUKURA LEARNED TO
MAKE NETS</h4></div>

<p class="center"><i>From New Zealand</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time there lived a man named Kahukura.
One evening, when he was on his way to
a distant village, he came to a lonely spot on
the seashore. As he was walking slowly along,
he saw a large pile of the heads and tails of fishes
lying on the beach. Now, in those days men had
no nets and were obliged to catch fish with spears
and hooks; and when Kahukura saw the pile he
was very much astonished.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who has had such luck!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;It
is hard to catch one fish! Here must be the heads
and tails of a thousand!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he looked closely at the footprints in the
sand. &#8220;No mortals have been fishing here!&#8221; he
cried. &#8220;Fairies must have done this! I will
watch to-night and see what they do.&#8221;</p>

<p>So when darkness came, he returned to the
spot, and hid behind a rock. He waited a long
time, and at last he saw a fleet of tiny canoes
come spinning over the waves. They ranged
themselves in a line at a distance from the shore,
and Kahukura could see many little figures in
them bending and pulling. He could even hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
small voices shouting: &#8220;The net here! The net
there!&#8221; Then the little figures dropped something
overboard, and began to haul it toward the
shore, singing very sweetly the while.</p>

<p>When the canoes drew near land, Kahukura
saw that each was crowded with Fairies. They
all sprang out upon the beach, and began to
drag ashore a great net filled with fishes.</p>

<p>While the Fairies were struggling with the net
Kahukura joined them, and hauled away at a
rope. He was a very fair man, so that his skin
seemed almost as white as the Fairies&#8217;, and they
did not notice him. So he pulled away, and
pulled away, and soon the net was landed.</p>

<p>The Fairies ran forward to divide the catch. It
was just at the peep of dawn, and they hurried
to take all the fish they could carry, each Fairy
stringing his share by running a twig through
the gills. And as they strung the fish they kept
calling out to one another:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurry! hurry! We must finish before the
sun rises.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kahukura had a short string with a knot in
the end, and he strung his share on it, until it
was filled. But when he lifted the string the knot
gave way, and all the fish slid to the ground. Then
some of the Fairies ran forward to help him, and
tied the knot. Again he filled the string and all the
fish slid off, and again the Fairies tied the knot.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>Meanwhile day began to break over the sea,
and the sun to rise. Then the Fairies saw Kahukura&#8217;s
face, and knew that he was a man. They
gave little cries of terror. They ran this way and
that in confusion. They left their fish and canoes,
they abandoned their net. And shrieking they
all vanished over the sea.</p>

<p>Kahukura, seeing that he was alone, made
haste to examine the canoes. They were only the
stems of flax! He lifted the net. It was woven of
rushes curiously tied. He carried it home, and
made some like it for his neighbours. After that
he taught his children how to weave nets. And
so, say the Maori folk, they all learned to make
nets. And from that day to this they have caught
many fish.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">ECHO, THE CAVE FAIRY</h4></div>

<p class="center"><i>From the Island of Mangaia</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the very long ago, Rangi the Brave came from
the Land-of-the-Bright-Parrot-Feathers to the
Island of Mangaia. Swiftly over the blue waves
sped his canoe. He stepped out upon the land,
and lay down to rest in the shade of a broad-leaved
tree covered with gorgeous blooms. And
after he had slept and was refreshed, he arose and
wandered about the island.</p>

<p>Beautiful was the place with cocoa palms waving
their tall fronds in the air, and with banana
trees heavy with golden fruit. But though Rangi
walked all that day and the next, he saw no human
being. He heard no sounds except the beat
of the sea against the shore, and the whirring of
hundreds of bright-winged birds that passed like
flashes of blue, green, and crimson, from tree to
tree, and from grove to grove. Softly the perfumed
breezes fanned his cheek, and played in
his hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Like a lovely dream is this island!&#8221; thought
he, &#8220;but as lonely as the sea on a moonlit
night!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then to comfort himself he threw back his
head and called: &#8220;Halloo! Halloo!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>And from a pile of rocks overhanging a deep
gorge, a voice answered: &#8220;Halloo!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who art thou?&#8221; cried Rangi in wonder.
&#8220;What is thy name?&#8221;</p>

<p>And the voice answered more softly: &#8220;What
is thy name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where art thou? Where art thou hidden?&#8221;
he shouted.</p>

<p>And the voice answered mockingly: &#8220;Where
art thou hidden?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Rangi in anger shouted fiercely: &#8220;Accursed
be thou, hide-and-seek spirit!&#8221;</p>

<p>And the voice screamed back as if in derision:
&#8220;Accursed be thou!&#8221;</p>

<p>Thereupon Rangi grasped his spear tighter,
and strode toward the rocks, determined to
punish the insolent one. Leaping from boulder
to boulder, he entered the gorge. And ever
as he proceeded, he shouted threats; and ever
the mocking voice answered from some distant
spot.</p>

<p>The gorge grew darker and narrower, until
Rangi suddenly found himself in a wide-mouthed
cavern. Its walls and roof glittered with pendant
crystals from which fell, drop by drop, clear
water like dew. A white mist rose from the
rocky floor, and through it Rangi saw dimly a
lovely Fairy face gazing roguishly at him. It
was wreathed in rippling hair, and crowned with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
flowers. Archly it smiled, then melted away in
the mist.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who art thou?&#8221; whispered Rangi in awe.
&#8220;Art thou Echo indeed?&#8221;</p>

<p>And from the glittering walls and roof came a
thousand sweet answers:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Echo indeed!&#8221;</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">THE MAGIC FERNS</h4></div>

<p class="center"><i>From Cornwall</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Not</span> many years since there lived in Cornwall
a pretty young girl named Cherry. As she and
her mother were poor, Cherry determined to go
out to service. So one morning early, she took
her little bundle of clothes, and started out to
find a place with some respectable family. She
walked until she came to four cross-roads, and,
not knowing which to follow, she sat down on a
boulder to think.</p>

<p>The spot where she sat was covered with beautiful
ferns that curled their delicate fronds over
the boulder. And while she was lost in thought,
she unconsciously picked a few fronds and crushed
them in her hand.</p>

<p>Immediately she heard a strange voice at her
elbow say:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;My pretty young woman, what are you looking
for?&#8221;</p>

<p>She glanced up, and saw standing near her a
handsome young man, who was holding a bunch
of the ferns.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am looking for a place, sir,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what kind of a place do you wish?&#8221;
asked he, with a sweet and winning smile.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>&#8220;I am not particular,&#8221; answered she. &#8220;I can
make myself generally useful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed!&#8221; said the stranger. &#8220;And do you
think you could look after one little boy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That I&#8217;d love to do!&#8221; said she, smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; replied he, &#8220;I wish to hire you for a
year and a day. My home is not far from here.
Will you go with me, Cherry, and see it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Cherry stared in astonishment to hear him
speak her name; and he added:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I see you thought that I did not know
you! I watched you one day while you were
dressing your hair beside one of my ponds; and I
saw you pluck some of my sweetest-scented violets
to put in those lovely tresses! But will you
go with me, Cherry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For a year and a day?&#8221; asked she.</p>

<p>&#8220;You need not be alarmed,&#8221; said he very
kindly. &#8220;Just kiss the fern leaf that is in your
hand, and say:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8216;<i>For a year and a day</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>I promise to stay!</i>&#8217;&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;Is that all!&#8221; said Cherry. So she kissed the
fern leaf, and said the words as he told her
to.</p>

<p>Instantly the young man passed the bunch of
ferns that he held over both her eyes. The ground
in front of her seemed to open; and, though she
did not feel herself move from the boulder where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
she sat, yet she knew that she was going down
rapidly into the earth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here we are, Cherry,&#8221; said the young man.
&#8220;Is there a tear of sorrow under your eyelid? If
so, let me wipe it away, for no human tear can
enter our dwelling.&#8221;</p>

<p>And as he spoke he brushed Cherry&#8217;s eyes with
the fern leaves. And, lo! before her was such a
country as she had never dreamed of!</p>

<p>Hills and valleys were covered with flowers
strangely brilliant, so that the whole country appeared
to be sown with gems that glittered in
a light as clear as that of the Summer sun, yet
as mild as moonshine. There were glimmering
rivers, and singing waterfalls, and sparkling
fountains; while everywhere beautiful little ladies
and gentlemen, dressed in green and gold, were
walking, or sitting on banks of flowers. Oh! it
was a wonderful world!</p>

<p>&#8220;Here we are at home!&#8221; said the young man&mdash;and
strangely enough he was changed! He had
become the handsomest little man Cherry had
ever seen, and he wore a green silk coat covered
with spangles of gold.</p>

<p>He led her into a noble mansion, the furniture
of which was of ivory and pearl, inlaid with gold
and silver and studded with emeralds. After
passing through many rooms they came to one
whose walls were hung with lace as fine as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
finest cobwebs, and most beautifully twined with
flowers. In the middle of the room was a cradle
of wrought sea-shell, reflecting so many colours
that Cherry could scarcely bear to look at it.
The little man led her to this, and in it was lying
asleep a little boy so beautiful that he ravished
the sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is your charge,&#8221; said the little man. &#8220;I
am King of this country, and I wish my son to
know something of human nature. You have
nothing to do but to wash and dress the boy
when he wakes, to take him walking in the garden,
to tell him stories, and to put him to sleep
when he is weary.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cherry was delighted beyond words, for at
first sight she loved the darling little boy. And
when he woke, he seemed to love her just as
dearly. She was very happy, and cared tenderly
for him; and the time passed away with astonishing
rapidity. In fact it seemed scarcely a week
later, when she opened her eyes and found everything
about her changed. Indeed, there she was
lying in her own bed in her mother&#8217;s cottage!</p>

<p>She heard her mother calling her name with
joy; and the neighbours came crowding around
her bed. It was just one year and a day from the
time when she had sat on the boulder, and had
met the fine young man. She told her adventures
to all, but they would not believe her. They shook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
their heads and went away, saying: &#8220;Poor Cherry
is certainly mad!&#8221;</p>

<p>From that day on, she was never happy, but
sat pining, and dreaming of the hour when she
had picked the magic ferns. And though she
often went back to the boulder, she never again
saw the young man, nor found the way to Fairyland.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">THE SMITH AND THE FAIRIES</h4></div>

<p class="center"><i>From Scotland</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Years</span> ago there lived in Scotland an honest,
hard-working smith. He had only one child, a
boy, fourteen years of age, cheerful, strong, and
healthy.</p>

<p>Suddenly the boy fell ill. He took to his bed,
and moped away whole days. No one could tell
what was the matter with him. Although he had
a tremendous appetite, he wasted away, getting
thin, yellow, and old.</p>

<p>At last one morning, while the smith was standing
idly at his forge, with no heart for work, he
was surprised to see a Wise-man, who lived at
some distance, enter his shop. The smith hastened
to tell him about his son, and to ask his
advice.</p>

<p>The Wise-man listened gravely, then said:
&#8220;The boy has been carried away by the Little
People, and they have left a Changeling in his
place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alas! And what am I to do?&#8221; asked the
smith. &#8220;How am I ever to see my own son
again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will tell you how,&#8221; answered the Wise-man.
&#8220;But first, to make sure that it is not your own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
son you have, gather together all the egg-shells
you can get. Go into the room where the boy
is, and spread them out carefully before him.
Then pour water in them, and carry them carefully
in your hands, two by two. Carry them as
though they were very heavy, and arrange them
around the fireplace.&#8221;</p>

<p>The smith, accordingly, collected as many
egg-shells as he could find. He went into the
room, and did as the Wise-man had said.</p>

<p>He had not been long at work, before there
came from the bed where the boy lay, a great
shout of laughter, and the boy cried out:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am now eight hundred years old, and I have
never seen the like of that before!&#8221;</p>

<p>The smith hurried back, and told this to the
Wise-man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did I not assure you,&#8221; said the Wise-man,
&#8220;that it is not your son whom you have? Your
son is in a Fairy Mound not far from here. Get
rid as soon as possible of this Changeling, and I
think I may promise you your son again.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must light a very great and bright fire
before the bed on which this stranger is lying.
He will ask you why you are doing so. Answer
him at once: &#8216;You shall see presently when I lay
you upon it.&#8217; If you do this, the Changeling will
become frightened and fly through the roof.&#8221;</p>

<p>The smith again followed the Wise-man&#8217;s advice;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
kindled a blazing fire, and answered as he
had been told to do. And, just as he was going
to seize the Changeling and fling him on the fire,
the thing gave an awful yell, and sprang through
the roof.</p>

<p>The smith, overjoyed, returned to the Wise-man,
and told this to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;On Midsummer Night,&#8221; said the Wise-man,
&#8220;the Fairy Mound, where your boy is kept, will
open. You must provide yourself with a dirk
and a crowing cock. Go to the Mound. You will
hear singing and dancing and much merriment
going on. At twelve o&#8217;clock a door in the Mound
will open. Advance boldly. Enter this door, but
first stick the dirk in the ground before it, to
prevent the Mound from closing. You will find
yourself in a spacious apartment, beautifully
clean; and there working at a forge, you will see
your son. The Fairies will then question you,
and you must answer that you have come for
your son, and will not go without him. Do this,
and see what happens!&#8221;</p>

<p>Midsummer Night came, and the smith provided
himself with a dirk and a crowing cock.
He went to the Fairy Mound, and all happened
as the Wise-man had said.</p>

<p>The Fairies came crowding around him, buzzing
and pinching his legs; and when he said that
he had come for his son, and would not go away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
without him, they all gave a loud laugh. At the
same minute the cock, that was dozing in the
smith&#8217;s arms, woke up. It leaped to his shoulder,
and, clapping its wings, crowed loud and long.</p>

<p>At that the Fairies were furious. They seized
the smith and his son and threw them out of the
Mound, and pulled up the dirk and flung it after
them. And in an instant all was dark.</p>

<p>For a year and a day the boy never spoke, nor
would he do a turn of work. At last one morning
as he was watching his father finish a sword, he
exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not the way to do it!&#8221;</p>

<p>And taking the tools from his father&#8217;s hands,
he set to work, and soon fashioned a glittering
sharp sword, the like of which had never been
seen before.</p>

<p>From that day on, the boy helped his father,
and showed him how to make Fairy swords, and
in a few years they both became rich and famous.
And they always lived together contentedly and
happily.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">THE COAL-BLACK STEED</h4></div>

<p class="center"><i>From England</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Late</span> one night&mdash;a bright, quiet, moonlit night&mdash;old
Dame Moll lay snugly sleeping in her bed,
when suddenly she was wakened by a noise like
a rushing storm. The next minute there came a
loud <i>rap! rap! rap!</i> at her cottage door.</p>

<p>Startled and frightened she sprang out of bed,
and opened the door on a crack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid, good woman,&#8221; said a
squeaky voice. &#8220;Open wide! Open wide!&#8221;</p>

<p>So she opened a bit wider, and saw a strange,
squint-eyed, ugly little fellow standing on the
door-stone. Somehow the look in his eyes seemed
to cast a spell over her, and made her, willy-nilly,
open the door very wide.</p>

<p>&#8220;My wife has sent for you, good woman,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;You must come with me and bathe
and dress our new-born child.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your wife!&#8221; thought the poor Dame.
&#8220;Heaven defend me! Sure as I live I am going
to care for a little Imp!&#8221;</p>

<p>But she could not refuse to go, for the spell in
the little man&#8217;s eyes drew her, and she was forced
to walk toward a coal-black steed that stood
snorting before the door. Its eyes were red-hot
balls, and its breath was like smoke.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>And how Dame Moll got to the place she never
could tell. But suddenly she found herself set
down by a neat but poor cottage, and saw two
tidy children playing before the door. In a minute
she was seated in front of a roaring hearth-fire,
washing and dressing a small baby. But a very
active and naughty baby it was, though only an
hour old; for it lifted its fist and gave the good
Dame such a rousing box on her ear, that it made
her head ring.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anoint its eyes with this salve, my good
woman,&#8221; said the mother, who was lying in a
neat white bed.</p>

<p>So Dame Moll took the box of salve, and
rubbed a bit on the child&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not a drop on mine,&#8221; thought she,
&#8220;since it must be Elfin ointment.&#8221; So she rubbed
her finger over her right eye.</p>

<p>O ye powers of Fairyland! What did she see!</p>

<p>The neat but homely cottage had become a
great and beautiful room. The mother, dressed
in white silk, lay in an ivory bed. The babe was
robed in silvery gauze. The two older children,
who had just come into the cottage, were seated
one on either side of the mother&#8217;s pillow. But
they, too, were changed! For now they were
little flat-nosed Imps who, with mops and mows,
and with many a grin and grimace, were pulling
the mother&#8217;s ears with their long, hairy paws.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>When Dame Moll saw this, she knew that she
was in a place of enchantment, and without saying
a word about having anointed her own eye,
she made haste to finish dressing the Elfin babe.</p>

<p>Then the squint-eyed little old fellow once
more placed her behind him on the coal-black
steed, and away they went sailing through the
air. And he set her down safely before her door.</p>

<p>On the next market-day, when Dame Moll was
selling eggs, what did she see but the little old
fellow himself busied, like a rogue, stealing some
things from the market-stalls.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Ho!&#8221; cried she; &#8220;I&#8217;ve caught you, you
thief!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; exclaimed he. &#8220;Do you see me to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See you! To be sure I do!&mdash;as plain as the
sun in the sky! And I see you very busy stealing,
into the bargain!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With which eye do you see me?&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;With my right eye, to be sure,&#8221; answered
Dame Moll.</p>

<p>&#8220;The ointment! The ointment!&#8221; exclaimed
the little man. &#8220;Take that for meddling with
what did not belong to you!&#8221;</p>

<p>And he struck her in the eye as he spoke. And
from that day to this old Dame Moll has been
blind in the right eye. And surely it served her
right for stealing the Fairy ointment.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">THE GIRL WHO WAS STOLEN BY
THE FAIRIES</h4></div>

<p class="center"><i>From Ireland</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Never</span> go near an Elfin Mound on May Day.
For in the month of May the Fairies are very
powerful, and they wander about the meadows
looking for pretty maidens to carry off to Fairyland.</p>

<p>One beautiful May Day in old Ireland, a
young girl fell asleep at noonday on an Elfin
Mound. The Fairies saw how pretty she was,
so they carried her off to Fairyland, and left in
her stead an image that looked exactly like her.</p>

<p>Evening fell, and as the girl did not return
home, her mother sent the neighbours to look
for her in all directions. They found the image,
and, thinking that it was the girl herself, they
carried it home, and laid it in her bed. But the
image neither moved nor spoke, and lay there
silently for two days.</p>

<p>On the morning of the third day an old Witch-woman
entered the house, and looking at the
image, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your daughter is Fairy-struck. Rub this
ointment on her forehead, and see what you shall
see!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>Then the old woman placed a vial of green
ointment in the mother&#8217;s hand, and disappeared.</p>

<p>The mother immediately rubbed the forehead
of the image, and the girl herself sat up in bed,
weeping and wringing her hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, mother!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Oh, why did you
bring me back! I was so happy! I was in a
beautiful palace where handsome Princesses and
Princes were dancing to the sweetest music.
They made me dance with them, and threw a
mantle of rich gold over my shoulders. Now it is
all gone, and I shall never see the beautiful palace
any more!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the mother wept, and said: &#8220;Oh, my
child, stay with me! I have no other daughter
but you! And if the Fairies take you, I shall die!&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl wept loudly at this, and throwing her
arms around her mother&#8217;s neck, kissed her, and
promised that she would not go near the Elfin
Mound. And she kept her word, so she never
saw the Fairies again.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">THE GIRL WHO DANCED WITH
THE FAIRIES</h4></div>

<p class="center"><i>From Ireland</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> must never wander about alone on Hallowe&#8217;en,
for then the Fairies are abroad looking
for mortals to trick and lead astray.</p>

<p>Now, there was once a girl, the prettiest girl
in all Ireland, who late one Hallowe&#8217;en was going
to a spring to fetch some water. Her foot slipped,
and she fell. When she got up, she looked about
her, and saw that she was in a very strange place.
A great fire was burning near, around which
a number of people, beautifully dressed, were
dancing.</p>

<p>A handsome young man, like a Prince, with a
red sash, and a golden band in his hair, left the
fire, and came toward her. He greeted her kindly,
and asked her to dance.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a foolish thing, sir, to ask me to dance,&#8221;
replied she, &#8220;since there is no music.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that the young man lifted his hand, and
instantly the most delicious music sounded.
Then he took her by the fingers and drew her into
the dance. Around and around they whirled,
and they danced and danced until the moon and
stars went down. And all the time, the girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
seemed to float in the air, and she forgot everything
except the sweet music and the young
man.</p>

<p>At last the dancing ceased, and a door opened
in the earth. The young man, who seemed to be
the King of all, led the girl down a pair of stairs,
followed by all the gay company. At the end
of a long passage they came to a hall bright and
beautiful with gold and silver and lights. A table
was covered with every good thing to eat, and
wine was poured out in golden cups.</p>

<p>The young man lifted a cup, and offered it to
the girl; at the same moment some one whispered
in her ear:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not drink! Do not eat! If you do either,
you will never see your home again!&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, the girl, when she heard that, set the cup
down and refused to drink. Immediately all the
company grew angry. A great buzzing arose.
The lights went out. And the girl felt something
grasp her, and rush her forth from the hall and
up the stairs; and in a minute she found herself
beside the spring holding her pitcher in her
hand.</p>

<p>She did not wait for anything, but ran home
as fast as she could, and locked herself in tight,
and crept into bed. Then she heard a great
clamour of little voices outside her door, and she
could hear them cry:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>&#8220;The power we had over you to-night is gone,
because you refused to drink! But wait until
next Hallowe&#8217;en Night, when you dance with
us on the hill! Then we shall keep you forever!&mdash;forever!&#8221;</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">ELIDORE AND THE GOLDEN BALL</h4></div>

<p class="center"><i>From Wales</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time, in the land of Wales, near the
fall of the Tawe into the sea, there lived a boy
called Elidore. He was a bright lad, but so fond
of play that he would not study at all. His
teacher flogged him so often and so hard that one
morning Elidore ran away from home, and hid
under a hollow bank by the side of the river.</p>

<p>There he stayed two nights and two days, getting
hungrier and thirstier every moment. At
last, when it seemed as if he could stand his sufferings
no longer, he saw a little door open in the
side of the bank and two Elfin Men step out.
They stood before him, and, bowing low, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come with us, dear boy, and we will lead
you to a land full of delights and sports, where
you may play all the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Elidore was overjoyed. He rose and followed
the Elfin Men through the door. They conducted
him down a long, dark passage through the hill.
At length they came out into a beautiful country
adorned with singing crystal streams and
flowery meadows. But it was always twilight
there, for the light of the sun, moon, and stars
could not reach that land.</p>

<p>The Elfin Men led Elidore to a golden palace,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
and presented him to the King of the Elves, who
was seated upon his throne and was surrounded
by a train of little people richly clad. The King
questioned Elidore kindly, then, calling his eldest
son, the Elfin Prince, bade him take the earth-boy
and make him happy.</p>

<p>So Elidore dwelt in Elfinland, and day after
day was fed with milk and saffron; and he played
with the Elfin Prince, tossing gold and silver balls.
When he walked in the meadows to pick flowers,
he saw everywhere about him the Elfin people,
with long, flowing yellow hair, riding on little
horses and chasing tiny deer with Fairy hounds.
For all the people in Elfinland played and rode
about night and day, and they never worked.
Sometimes on moonlit nights they rode through
the dark passage to the upper world, and danced
in Fairy Rings on the grass. And when they went
to their dances, they took Elidore with them.</p>

<p>After Elidore had lived in Elfinland for some
time, the King permitted him one moonlit night
to go alone through the dark passage to visit his
mother. He did so, and she was delighted to see
him, for she had thought him dead. He told her
about the wonders of Elfinland, and how he was
fed on milk and saffron, and played with gold and
silver toys. She begged him, the next time he
came, to bring her a bit of Fairy Gold. He promised
to do so, and returned to Elfinland.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>It so happened, one day soon after this, that
Elidore was playing with the Elfin Prince. He
snatched a beautiful golden ball from the Prince&#8217;s
hands, and hastened with it through the dark
passage. As he ran he heard behind him the
shouts of many angry Elves and the sound of
their horses&#8217; hoofs, and the barking of the Fairy
dogs; and knew that he was being pursued.</p>

<p>Faster he ran in terror, but nearer came the
patter of a thousand little feet, and the Elfin
shouts. Still more terrified, he rushed through
the door in the hill and sped homeward. As he
sprang into his mother&#8217;s house his foot caught,
and he fell over the threshold. At the same moment
two Elves, who had outrun the others,
leaped over him and snatched the golden ball
from his hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thief!&#8221; &#8220;Robber!&#8221; &#8220;Thief!&#8221; they screamed,
and vanished.</p>

<p>As for Elidore, he rose up too ashamed to eat
or sleep that night. The next day he went to the
river bank and searched for the door, but could
find no trace of it. And though he searched every
day for a year, he never again found the entrance
to Elfinland.</p>

<p>But from that time he was a changed boy. He
studied hard, loved truth, and hated lying and
stealing. And, when he grew up, he became a
great man in Wales.</p>

THE LITTLE GLASS SLIPPER</h4></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time there was a gentleman who
married for his second wife a woman who was
the haughtiest and proudest ever seen. She had
two daughters who resembled her in temper. The
husband, however, had a young daughter by his
first wife, who was of a sweetness and goodness
without limit. She was like her own mother, who
had been the most sweet-tempered woman in the
world.</p>

<p>The wedding was no sooner over than the stepmother
began to show her bad disposition. She
could not endure the young girl, whose sweetness
made her own daughters seem more detestable.
She forced her to do the hardest work in
the house. It was she who washed the dishes and
put them in their places. It was she who polished
the bedroom floors for her stepmother and
two sisters. She slept under the eaves in a garret,
on a wretched mattress; while her sisters lay in
elegant rooms where the beds were soft and white,
and the walls were lined with long mirrors in which
the sisters could see themselves from head to foot.</p>

<p>The poor girl suffered all this with patience.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
And she did not dare complain to her father, for
he would have scolded her, as he was completely
governed by his wife.</p>

<p>Each day, after the girl had finished her work,
she sat down in the chimney-corner among the
cinders&mdash;so they called her Cinderella. Nevertheless,
Cinderella, in spite of her shabby clothes,
was more polite and a hundred times more beautiful
than her sisters, although they were magnificently
dressed.</p>

<p>It happened one day that the King&#8217;s son gave
a ball, and that he invited everybody of rank.
The ugly sisters were also invited, because they
always made a grand figure at all Court festivities.
They were very glad at the thought of
attending the royal ball, and busied themselves
in choosing the robes and head-dresses which
should be most becoming. But, alas! it was more
trouble and work for Cinderella, for it was she
who did her sisters&#8217; ironing, and fluted their
ruffles. Night and morning, they talked only of
their clothes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I,&#8221; said the eldest, &#8220;shall wear my red velvet
robe with rich lace trimming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I,&#8221; said the younger, &#8220;shall have only my
plain skirt, but to make up for its plainness, I
shall put on my cloak flowered with gold, and
my tiara of diamonds.&#8221;</p>

<p>They called in Cinderella to ask her advice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
for she had excellent taste. Cinderella gave
them the best counsel in the world, and even
offered to do their hair, for which they were very
glad. And while she was arranging their locks in
two rows of puffs, they asked:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cinderella, would you not be delighted to go
to the ball?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alas, you are mocking me!&#8221; replied she. &#8220;It
would be no place for me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; answered the sisters, laughing
scornfully. &#8220;Everybody would laugh well to
see such a scrub-girl as you at the ball!&#8221;</p>

<p>Any one but Cinderella would have done their
hair crooked out of rage, but she was so sweet
that she did her very best. They went two days
without eating, so excited were they with joy.
They broke a dozen lacings trying to make their
waists smaller, and they spent all their time before
the mirrors.</p>

<p>At last the happy day arrived, and as they
departed for the ball, Cinderella followed them
with her eyes as long as she could. Then she
burst into tears.</p>

<p>Her Godmother, who saw her in tears, asked
what was the matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish&mdash;I wish&mdash;&#8221; and Cinderella sobbed
so that she could not finish.</p>

<p>Her Godmother, who was a Fairy, said: &#8220;You
wish to go to the ball, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>&#8220;Alas! Yes!&#8221; sighed Cinderella.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then be a good girl,&#8221; said her Godmother,
&#8220;and you shall go. Now, run into the garden
and bring me a pumpkin.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cinderella went, and picked the biggest she
could find; and as she carried it to her Godmother,
she wondered how that pumpkin could
help her go to the ball.</p>

<p>Her Godmother scooped out all the inside,
leaving only the rind which she struck with her
wand. Instantly it became a golden coach. Then
she went to look at the mousetrap in which she
found six mice. She bade Cinderella open the
trap, and, as each mouse sprang out, she touched
it with her wand. And instantly it was changed
into a handsome horse.</p>

<p>As the Godmother was wondering out of what
to make a coachman, Cinderella said: &#8220;I will
go and see if there is a rat in the trap&mdash;then we
can make a coachman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a good thought,&#8221; said her Godmother,
&#8220;go and see.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cinderella brought the trap in which were
three large rats. Her Godmother chose one of
the three because of his long whiskers; and when
she touched him, he was instantly changed into a
big coachman who had the handsomest moustaches
ever seen.</p>

<p>Then she said to Cinderella: &#8220;Go into the garden.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
You will find there six lizards behind the
watering-pot. Bring them to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cinderella had no sooner brought them than
they were changed into six footmen in gold-laced
coats, who sprang up behind the coach with the
air of never having done anything else in their
lives.</p>

<p>Then the Fairy said to Cinderella: &#8220;Here is a
fine coach in which to go to the ball! Are you
not glad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied she, &#8220;but must I go in these
ugly clothes?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her Godmother, in answer, touched her with
her wand, and instantly her old clothes were
changed into robes of gold and silver embroidered
with gems. Then her Godmother presented her
with a pair of glass slippers, the prettiest in the
world.</p>

<p>Now that Cinderella was all dressed, she got
into the coach; but her Godmother told her above
all things not to remain a minute later than midnight.
For if she remained a single minute longer,
her coach would become a pumpkin; her horses,
mice; her coachman, a rat; and her footmen, lizards;
while all her fine clothes would change to
rags.</p>

<p>Cinderella promised her Godmother that she
would not fail to return before midnight.</p>

<p>She departed for the ball, so joyful that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
did not know herself. The King&#8217;s son, who was
informed by his servants of the arrival of a
beautiful Princess whom nobody knew, ran to
receive her. He assisted her to descend from the
coach, and led her into the hall where the guests
were assembled.</p>

<p>There was a great silence. People stopped
dancing, and the violins ceased playing, while
all crowded around to see the beauty of the
unknown one. Then a confused murmur arose.
&#8220;Oh, how beautiful she is!&#8221; The King even, old
as he was, could not take his eyes off her, and
he whispered to the Queen that it was long since
he had seen such a handsome and amiable person.</p>

<p>All the ladies were anxious to examine her
head-dress and robes, and they decided to have
some made like them the very next morning,
provided, of course, that they could procure
beautiful enough materials and needlewomen
sufficiently skilful.</p>

<p>The King&#8217;s son led Cinderella to the place of
honour, and asked her to dance with him. She
danced with such grace that she was more admired
than ever. A superb banquet was served,
but the young Prince did not taste it, so much
was he occupied in gazing at her. She seated
herself by her sisters, and showed them a thousand
attentions. She offered them a share of the
oranges and lemons that the Prince had given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
her, which greatly surprised them, for they did
not know her.</p>

<p>While they were chatting, Cinderella heard
the clock strike a quarter before twelve. She
immediately bowed to the company, and hastened
away as fast as she could.</p>

<p>When she arrived at home, she found her
Fairy Godmother, and having thanked her, told
her how she longed to go again the next night,
for the Prince had invited her. And while she
was relating all the things that had happened at
the ball, she heard the two sisters rap at the
door.</p>

<p>Cinderella opened it. &#8220;How late you are,&#8221;
she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you had been at the ball,&#8221; replied one of
the sisters, &#8220;you would not think it late! There
came the most beautiful Princess you have ever
dreamed of. She was devoted to us, and gave us
oranges and lemons.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cinderella could scarcely contain herself for
joy. She asked the name of the Princess.</p>

<p>&#8220;We do not know,&#8221; they said. &#8220;Even the
King&#8217;s son is curious to learn who she is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cinderella smiled and said to the elder sister:
&#8220;Was she so beautiful then! How happy you
are!&#8221;</p>

<p>The next night the sisters went to the ball.
Cinderella went, too, even more magnificently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
attired than the first time. The King&#8217;s son was
constantly by her side, and never ceased whispering
sweet things. Cinderella was not at all
weary, and she forgot what her Godmother had
told her; so that when she heard the first stroke
of midnight, she could not believe that it was
more than eleven o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>She sprang up, and fled as swiftly as a deer.
The Prince followed her, but could not catch
her. She lost one of her glass slippers, which he
tenderly picked up.</p>

<p>Cinderella reached home breathless, without
coach or footmen, and clad in rags. Nothing remained
of all her splendour but one little glass
slipper, for she had dropped the other.</p>

<p>The Prince&#8217;s attendants asked the palace
guards if they had seen a Princess pass by. They
said that they had seen no one except a poorly
dressed girl, who looked more like a peasant than
a Princess.</p>

<p>When her sisters returned, Cinderella asked
if they had had a good time again, and if the
lovely Princess had been present. They said yes,
but that she had fled as soon as twelve o&#8217;clock
had sounded, and that she had dropped one of
her little glass slippers&mdash;it was the prettiest
thing!&mdash;and that the Prince had picked it up.
And that he had done nothing but look at it
for the rest of the night! Assuredly he must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
very much in love with the Princess to whom it
belonged!</p>

<p>And they were right. A few days after this
the King&#8217;s son sent a herald who announced, by
sound of a trumpet, that the Prince would marry
any lady whom the glass slipper fitted.</p>

<p>Then commenced a great trying-on by Princesses
and Duchesses and all the ladies of the
Court&mdash;but it was of no use. At last they
brought the glass slipper to the two sisters, who
did their best to get their feet into it, but they
could not do so.</p>

<p>Cinderella, who was looking on and recognized
her slipper, said smilingly: &#8220;Let me see if it will
fit me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her sisters began to laugh scornfully and to
ridicule her; but the attendant who held the
slipper, looking attentively at Cinderella, saw
that she was very beautiful, and said that she
had a right to do so, for he had been ordered to
try the slipper on every girl in the Kingdom.</p>

<p>He made Cinderella seat herself, and, placing
the slipper on her little foot, saw that it went on
easily and fitted her like wax. The amazement
of the sisters was great, but was greater still
when Cinderella drew the other slipper from her
pocket and put it on her other foot.</p>

<p>Immediately the Fairy Godmother arrived,
and, having touched Cinderella&#8217;s clothes with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
her wand, changed them into garments more
magnificent than those she had worn before.</p>

<p>Then the two sisters recognized her for the
beautiful Princess whom they had seen at the
ball. They threw themselves at her feet, and
begged forgiveness for the cruel treatment she
had suffered. Cinderella raised and embraced
them, and assured them that she pardoned them
with all her heart, and that she now entreated
them to love her dearly.</p>

<p>She was then conducted to the palace of the
Prince, adorned as she was in all her magnificence.
The Prince found her more beautiful
than ever, and a few days after he married her
with great pomp.</p>

<p>Cinderella, who was as good as she was beautiful,
lodged her sisters in the palace, and married
them on the same day to two great lords of
the Court.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">THE SLEEPING BEAUTY IN THE
WOOD</h4></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time there lived a King and Queen
who were most miserable because they had no
children; but when a lovely baby girl was born
to them, they were two of the happiest people
in the world. And in order to make all things as
propitious as possible for the little Princess, they
invited seven Fairies who lived in the Kingdom,
to be her Godmothers.</p>

<p>When the christening ceremony was over,
there was a magnificent banquet given for the
Fairies. Before each of them was laid a plate of
massive gold, and a case&mdash;also of massive gold&mdash;containing
a spoon, a fork, and a knife, all
of the same precious metal, and richly studded
with diamonds and rubies.</p>

<p>But just as everybody was seated at the table,
who should enter but an old Fairy, who had not
been invited because for more than fifty years
she had been shut up in a tower, and was supposed
to be either dead or enchanted.</p>

<p>The King immediately commanded that a
chair should be placed for her at the table, but
he could not offer her a golden plate and case,
for only seven had been made for the seven Fairies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
The unreasonable old creature considered
herself insulted, and began to mutter frightful
threats between her teeth. The youngest of the
Fairies, hearing this, concealed herself behind
the tapestry, in order to be the last to speak, and
so perhaps prevent any harm being done to the
little Princess.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Godmothers began to bestow
their gifts.</p>

<p>One said: &#8220;My Godchild shall be the most
beautiful girl in the whole world.&#8221; The second
added: &#8220;And she shall have the disposition of an
angel.&#8221; The third said: &#8220;I give her the gift of
perfect grace and graciousness.&#8221; The fourth
added: &#8220;And she shall dance like a sylph.&#8221; The
fifth said: &#8220;She shall sing like a nightingale.&#8221;
The sixth added: &#8220;She shall excel in playing on
every sort of musical instrument.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then came the turn of the old Fairy, who
screamed like a cockatoo, while her head shook
more from rage than from age: &#8220;The Princess
shall pierce her hand with a spindle, and shall
die!&#8221;</p>

<p>These dreadful words made the whole company&mdash;every
one&mdash;shudder; and there was no one
there who was not drowned in tears. At that
moment the youngest Fairy appeared from behind
the tapestry, and said sweetly:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not weep, Your Majesties, your daughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
will not die. It is true that I have not power
enough to entirely undo the evil that my elder
sister has done. The Princess will hurt her hand
with a spindle, but, instead of dying, she will fall
asleep for a hundred years, and then a royal
Prince will come and waken her.&#8221;</p>

<p>The King, hoping to prevent this calamity,
forbade any person in the Kingdom either to
spin or even to keep a spindle in the house. Any
one who disobeyed was to be punished with
death.</p>

<p>Sixteen years after this, the King and Queen
went with their Court to a castle in the country,
when it happened that the young Princess, wandering
curiously from room to room, mounted to
the top of a tower. There she found an old woman
sitting alone before her wheel. This old woman
had never heard that the King had forbidden
any one to spin.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing, my good mother?&#8221;
asked the Princess.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am spinning, my beautiful child,&#8221; answered
the old woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, how pretty it is!&#8221; exclaimed the Princess.
&#8220;How do you do it? Give that to me, so I
may see if I can do as well!&#8221;</p>

<p>And as she spoke, she took the spindle so
eagerly and so quickly, that it pierced her hand,
and she sank fainting to the floor. The poor old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
woman, in the greatest distress, cried for help.
People came hurrying from all sides. They
dashed water on the Princess. They unlaced her
robes. They bathed her temples with perfumes.
But she did not move. Then the King, who,
hearing the commotion, was come into the tower-room,
remembered the malediction of the old
Fairy. He perceived that the misfortune was a
thing that had to come about, since the Fairies
had foretold it.</p>

<p>He caused the Princess to be carried to the most
splendid apartment in the castle, and to be laid
on a couch of down and on pillows of down embroidered
with gold and silver. Her eyes were
closed, but her soft breathing showed that she
was not dead. Then, too, her cheeks were flushed
a delicate rose-colour, and her lips were like
coral. She seemed a sleeping angel, she was so
beautiful.</p>

<p>The kind Fairy, who had saved the Princess&#8217;s
life, was in the Kingdom of Mataquin, twelve
thousand miles away, but the King instantly
sent word of the misfortune, by a little dwarf,
who travelled in seven-league boots&mdash;which are
boots that pass over seven leagues at each step&mdash;and
she arrived directly at the castle, in a chariot
of fire drawn by dragons.</p>

<p>She approved of all that the King had done.
But being exceedingly wise, she knew that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
poor Princess would be in a pitiable condition
when at the end of a hundred years she awoke
to find herself alone in that old castle. She
knew of but one thing to do, and she did it. At
a wave of her wand every one fell asleep&mdash;ladies
of honour, waiting-maids, squires, pages, stewards,
cooks, scullions, porters, footmen,&mdash;every
breathing thing, even the horses in the stables
with the grooms, the mastiffs in the courtyard,
and little Pouffi, the Princess&#8217;s lap dog, who was
nestling beside her on the couch&mdash;all slept. The
spits full of partridges over the fire, and even the
fire itself, waited silently to serve their mistress
when she should wake and need them.</p>

<p>Only the King and Queen were left to kiss their
darling child, and go away from the castle. The
King forbade any one to approach the place, but
this command was not necessary, for within a
quarter of an hour there was grown up around
the castle park, such a vast wood, whose trees,
great and small, were so interlaced with briars
and thorns, that neither man nor beast could
pass through. It was plain that the Fairy had
arranged matters after Fairy fashion, taking
care that the young Princess should not be disturbed
while she slept.</p>

<p>When the hundred years were gone, a King,
not of the family of the Princess, reigned over
the land. One day his son was hunting near the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
Fairy wood, and asked what were those turrets
he saw rising above the trees. People told him
everything that they had heard. One said that
it was an enchanted castle. Another said that
all the witches in the country held their revels
there. The most common belief, however, seemed
to be that it was the dwelling-place of an ogre,
who carried off all the children he could catch,
and devoured them at his leisure; for no one
could follow him, as only he could pass through
the wood.</p>

<p>While the Prince was lost in wonder at these
tales, an old peasant approached him, and said:
&#8220;Your Highness, more than fifty years ago I
heard my father say that in yonder castle was
the most beautiful Princess on earth, and that she
would sleep a hundred years and then be wakened
by the son of a King, and that she would
marry him.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was enough to set the Prince on fire for
the adventure. In fact, he felt in his heart that
he was the chosen one. He did not delay for an
instant. No sooner had he taken a step toward
the wood than the trees great and small, and the
thorns and briars, disentangled themselves and
opened a path.</p>

<p>He walked toward the castle which stood at
the end of a broad avenue. He saw, with surprise,
that none of his attendants had been able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
to follow him, for the wood had closed again
behind him; but all the same he went on boldly.</p>

<p>He entered a spacious outer court, where a
person less brave than he would have been paralyzed
by fear. A deathlike silence reigned, and many
dead men lay stretched upon the ground. But the
Prince saw, at a second glance, that the men had
only the appearance of being dead, that, indeed,
they were really men-at-arms, who had fallen asleep
with their half-emptied wine-glasses beside them.</p>

<p>He ascended the stairway. He entered an antechamber,
where the guard, ranged in line, with
their muskets on their shoulders, were snoring
contentedly. He crossed a presence-chamber
where many lords and ladies were sleeping, some
standing and some sitting.</p>

<p>Then he found himself in a magnificent apartment
where on a couch, whose curtains were lifted,
slept a young Princess as lovely as if she had
strayed from Paradise!</p>

<p>The Prince knelt beside her, and pressed his
lips on her white hand that lay on the coverlet.
The spell was broken! The Princess opened her
eyes, and, looking at the Prince as if he was no
stranger, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it you, my Prince! I know you, for the
Fairy has sent me such happy dreams in order
that I might know the one who should free me
from enchantment.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>Then they talked together. Each had so much
to say. The Prince forgot the flight of time, and
the Princess certainly did, it was so long since
she had talked with any one.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the whole castle had awakened when
the Princess did; and all the people had returned
to their regular duties. They were naturally half-starved.
Dinner was prepared.</p>

<p>Then the maid of honour, who was as hungry
as the others, and who really had difficulty to
keep her voice from being as sharp as her appetite,
went to the Princess&#8217;s apartment, and said
in a gentle tone: &#8220;Pardon, Your Highness, but
dinner is served.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Princess was superbly dressed, and the
Prince was careful not to say that her robe was
like that of his great-grandmother. He did not
find her any the less beautiful for all that. They
dined in the Hall of Mirrors, and were served by
the pages and ladies-in-waiting of the Princess.
The violins and hautboys played delightfully
considering that they had lain untouched for
a hundred years. After dinner, the Prince and
Princess were married in the chapel of the castle.
And on the death of the Prince&#8217;s father, which
occurred soon after the marriage, the Prince and
Princess reigned happily over all that land.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">PRINCE CHÉRI</h4></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Long</span> ago there lived a monarch, who was such a
very honest man that his subjects entitled him
&#8220;the Good King.&#8221; One day when he was out
hunting, a little white rabbit, which had been
half killed by his hounds, leaped right into His
Majesty&#8217;s arms. Said he, caressing it, &#8220;This
poor creature has put itself under my protection,
and I will allow no one to injure it.&#8221; So he carried
it to his palace, had prepared for it a neat
little rabbit-hutch, with abundance of the daintiest
food, such as rabbits love, and there he
left it.</p>

<p>The same night, when he was alone in his
chamber, there appeared to him a beautiful lady.
She was dressed neither in gold nor silver nor
brocade; but her flowing robes were white as snow,
and she wore a garland of white roses on her
head. The Good King was greatly astonished at
the sight, for his door was locked, and he wondered
how so dazzling a lady could possibly enter;
but she soon removed his doubts.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am the Fairy Candide,&#8221; said she, with a
smiling and gracious air. &#8220;Passing through the
wood, where you were hunting, I took a desire
to know if you were as good as men say you are.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
I therefore changed myself into a white rabbit,
and sought refuge in your arms. You saved me;
and now I know that those who are merciful to
dumb beasts will be ten times more so to human
beings. You merit the name your subjects give
you: you are the Good King. I thank you for
your protection, and shall be always one of your
best friends. You have but to say what you most
desire, and I promise you your wish shall be
granted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Madam,&#8221; replied the King, &#8220;if you are a
Fairy, you must know, without my telling you,
the wish of my heart. I have one well-beloved
son, Prince Chéri: whatever kindly feeling you
have toward me, extend it to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Willingly,&#8221; said Candide. &#8220;I will make him
the handsomest, richest, or most powerful Prince
in the world. Choose whichever you desire for
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None of the three,&#8221; returned the father. &#8220;I
only wish him to be good&mdash;the best Prince in
the world. Of what use would riches, power, or
beauty be to him if he were a bad man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; said the Fairy; &#8220;but I cannot
make him good: he must do that himself. I
can only change his external fortunes. For his
personal character, the utmost I can promise is
to give good counsel, reprove him for his faults,
and even punish him, if he will not punish himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
You mortals can do the same with your
children.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes!&#8221; said the King, sighing.</p>

<p>Still, he felt that the kindness of a Fairy was
something gained for his son, and died not long
after, content and at peace.</p>

<p>Prince Chéri mourned deeply, for he dearly
loved his father, and would have gladly given all
his kingdoms and treasures to keep him in life a
little longer.</p>

<p>Two days after the Good King was no more,
Prince Chéri was sleeping in his chamber, when
he saw the same dazzling vision of the Fairy Candide.</p>

<p>&#8220;I promised your father,&#8221; said she, &#8220;to be
your best friend, and in pledge of this take what
I now give you.&#8221; And she placed a small gold
ring upon his finger. &#8220;Poor as it looks, it is more
precious than diamonds; for whenever you do ill
it will prick your finger. If after that warning
you still continue in evil, you will lose my friendship,
and I shall become your direst enemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>So saying she disappeared, leaving Chéri in
such amazement that he would have believed it
all a dream, save for the ring on his finger.</p>

<p>He was for a long time so good that the ring
never pricked him at all; and this made him so
cheerful and pleasant in his humour that everybody
called him &#8220;Happy Prince Chéri.&#8221; But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
one unlucky day he was out hunting and found
no sport, which vexed him so much that he showed
his ill-temper by his looks and ways. He fancied
his ring felt very tight and uncomfortable, but
as it did not prick him, he took no heed of this;
until, reëntering his palace, his little pet dog,
Bibi, jumped up upon him, and was sharply told
to get away. The creature, accustomed to nothing
but caresses, tried to attract his attention
by pulling at his garments, when Prince Chéri
turned and gave it a severe kick. At this moment
he felt in his finger a prick like a pin.</p>

<p>&#8220;What nonsense!&#8221; said he to himself. &#8220;The
Fairy must be making game of me. Why, what
great evil have I done? I, the master of a great
empire, cannot I kick my own dog?&#8221;</p>

<p>A voice replied, or else Prince Chéri imagined it:
&#8220;No, sire; the master of a great empire has a right
to do good, but not evil. I&mdash;a Fairy&mdash;am as
much above you as you are above your dog. I
might punish you, kill you, if I chose; but I prefer
leaving you to amend your ways. You have
been guilty of three faults to-day&mdash;bad temper,
passion, cruelty. Do better to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Prince promised, and kept his word awhile;
but he had been brought up by a foolish nurse,
who indulged him in every way, and was always
telling him that he would be a King one day,
when he might do as he liked in all things. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
found out now that even a King cannot always
do that; it vexed him, and made him angry.
His ring began to prick him so often that his little
finger was continually bleeding. He disliked
this, as was natural, and soon began to consider
whether it would not be easier to throw the ring
away altogether than to be constantly annoyed
by it. It was such a queer thing for a King to
have always a spot of blood on his finger!</p>

<p>At last, unable to put up with it any more, he
took his ring off, and hid it where he would never
see it; and believed himself the happiest of men,
for he could now do exactly what he liked. He
did it, and became every day more and more
miserable.</p>

<p>One day he saw a young girl, so beautiful that,
being always accustomed to have his own way,
he immediately determined to marry her. He
never doubted that she would be only too glad
to be made a Queen, for she was very poor. But
Zelia&mdash;that was her name&mdash;answered, to his
great astonishment, that she would rather not
marry him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I displease you?&#8221; asked the Prince, into
whose mind it had never entered that he could
displease anybody.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all, my Prince,&#8221; said the honest peasant-maiden.
&#8220;You are very handsome, very
charming; but you are not like your father the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
Good King. I will not be your Queen, for you
would make me miserable.&#8221;</p>

<p>At these words the Prince&#8217;s love seemed all
to turn to hatred. He gave orders to his guards
to convey Zelia to a prison near the palace, and
then took counsel with his foster-brother, the one
of all his ill companions who most incited him
to do wrong.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir,&#8221; said this man, &#8220;if I were in Your
Majesty&#8217;s place, I would never vex myself about
a poor silly girl. Feed her on bread and water till
she comes to her senses; and if she still refuses
you, let her die in torment, as a warning to your
other subjects should they venture to dispute
your will. You will be disgraced should you suffer
yourself to be conquered by a simple girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said Prince Chéri, &#8220;shall I not be disgraced
if I harm a creature so perfectly innocent?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one is innocent who disputes Your
Majesty&#8217;s authority,&#8221; said the courtier, bowing;
&#8220;and it is better to commit an injustice than
allow it to be supposed you can ever be contradicted
with impunity.&#8221;</p>

<p>This touched Chéri on his weak point&mdash;his
good impulses faded. He resolved once more to
ask Zelia if she would marry him, and, if she
again refused, to sell her as a slave. Arrived at
the cell in which she was confined, what was his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
astonishment to find her gone! He knew not
whom to accuse, for he had kept the key in his
pocket the whole time. At last, the foster-brother
suggested that the escape of Zelia might have
been contrived by an old man, Suliman by name,
the Prince&#8217;s former tutor, who was the only one
who now ventured to blame him for anything
that he did. Chéri sent immediately, and ordered
his old friend to be brought to him, loaded heavily
with irons.</p>

<p>Then, full of fury, he went and shut himself
up in his own chamber, where he went raging to
and fro, till startled by a noise like a clap of
thunder. The Fairy Candide stood before him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Prince,&#8221; said she, in a severe voice, &#8220;I promised
your father to give you good counsels, and
to punish you if you refused to follow them. My
counsels were forgotten, my punishments despised.
Under the figure of a man, you have been
no better than the beasts you chase: like a lion
in fury, a wolf in gluttony, a serpent in revenge,
and a bull in brutality. Take, therefore, in your
new form the likeness of all these animals.&#8221;</p>

<p>Scarcely had Prince Chéri heard these words,
than to his horror he found himself transformed
into what the Fairy had named. He was a creature
with the head of a lion, the horns of a bull,
the feet of a wolf, and the tail of a serpent. At
the same time he felt himself transported to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
distant forest, where, standing on the bank of
a stream, he saw reflected in the water his own
frightful shape, and heard a voice saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at thyself, and know thy soul has become
a thousand times uglier even than thy
body.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chéri recognized the voice of Candide, and in
his rage would have sprung upon her and devoured
her; but he saw nothing, and the same
voice said behind him:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cease thy feeble fury, and learn to conquer
thy pride by being in submission to thine own
subjects.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hearing no more, he soon quitted the stream,
hoping at least to get rid of the sight of himself;
but he had scarcely gone twenty paces when he
tumbled into a pitfall that was laid to catch
bears. The bear-hunters, descending from some
trees hard by, caught him, chained him, and
only too delighted to get hold of such a curious-looking
animal, led him along with them to the
capital of his own Kingdom.</p>

<p>There great rejoicings were taking place, and
the bear-hunters, asking what it was all about,
were told that it was because Prince Chéri, the
torment of his subjects, had been struck dead
by a thunderbolt&mdash;just punishment of all his
crimes. Four courtiers, his wicked companions,
had wished to divide his throne among them;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
but the people had risen up against them, and
offered the crown to Suliman, the old tutor whom
Chéri had ordered to be arrested.</p>

<p>All this the poor monster heard. He even saw
Suliman sitting upon his own throne, and trying
to calm the populace by representing to them
that it was not certain Prince Chéri was dead;
that he might return one day to reassume with
honour the crown which Suliman only consented
to wear as a sort of viceroy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know his heart,&#8221; said the honest and faithful
old man; &#8220;it is tainted, but not corrupt. If
alive, he may reform yet, and be all his father
over again to you, his people, whom he has
caused to suffer so much.&#8221;</p>

<p>These words touched the poor beast so deeply
that he ceased to beat himself against the iron
bars of the cage in which the hunters carried him
about, became gentle as a lamb, and suffered
himself to be taken quietly to a menagerie, where
were kept all sorts of strange and ferocious animals&mdash;a
place which he had himself often
visited as a boy, but never thought he should
be shut up there himself.</p>

<p>However, he owned he had deserved it all, and
began to make amends by showing himself very
obedient to his keeper. This man was almost as
great a brute as the animals he had charge of,
and when he was in ill-humour he used to beat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
them without rhyme or reason. One day, while
he was sleeping, a tiger broke loose and leaped
upon him, eager to devour him. Chéri at first
felt a thrill of pleasure at the thought of being
revenged; then, seeing how helpless the man was,
he wished himself free, that he might defend him.
Immediately the doors of his cage opened.</p>

<p>The keeper, waking up, saw the strange beast
leap out, and imagined, of course, that he was
going to be slain at once. Instead, he saw the
tiger lying dead, and the strange beast creeping
up and laying itself at his feet to be caressed. But
as he lifted up his hand to stroke it, a voice
was heard saying, &#8220;Good actions never go unrewarded.&#8221;
And, instead of the frightful monster,
there crouched on the ground nothing but a pretty
little dog.</p>

<p>Chéri, delighted to find himself thus transformed,
caressed the keeper in every possible
way, till at last the man took him up into his
arms and carried him to the King, to whom he
related this wonderful story from beginning to
end. The Queen wished to have the charming
little dog; and Chéri would have been exceedingly
happy, could he have forgotten that he was
originally a man and a King. He was lodged
most elegantly, had the richest of collars to adorn
his neck, and heard himself praised continually.
But his beauty rather brought him into trouble,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
for the Queen, afraid lest he might grow too
large for a pet, took advice of dog-doctors, who
ordered that he should be fed entirely upon bread,
and that very sparingly; so poor Chéri was sometimes
nearly starved.</p>

<p>One day, when they gave him his crust for
breakfast, a fancy seized him to go and eat it in the
palace-garden; so he took the bread in his mouth,
and trotted away toward a stream which he
knew, and where he sometimes stopped to drink.
But instead of the stream he saw a splendid palace,
glittering with gold and precious stones.
Entering the doors was a crowd of men and
women, magnificently dressed; and within there
was singing and dancing, and good cheer of all
sorts. Yet, however grandly and gaily the people
went in, Chéri noticed that those who came out
were pale, thin, ragged, half-naked, covered with
wounds and sores. Some of them dropped dead
at once; others dragged themselves on a little way
and then lay down, dying of hunger, and vainly
begged a morsel of bread from others who were
entering in&mdash;who never took the least notice of
them.</p>

<p>Chéri perceived one woman, who was trying
feebly to gather and eat some green herbs. &#8220;Poor
thing!&#8221; said he to himself; &#8220;I know what it is
to be hungry, and I want my breakfast badly
enough; but still it will not kill me to wait till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
dinner-time, and my crust may save the life of
this poor woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the little dog ran up to her, and dropped his
bread at her feet; she picked it up, and ate it with
avidity. Soon she looked quite recovered, and
Chéri, delighted, was trotting back again to his
kennel, when he heard loud cries, and saw a young
girl dragged by four men to the door of the palace,
which they were trying to compel her to enter.
Oh, how he wished himself a monster again, as
when he slew the tiger! For the young girl was
no other than his beloved Zelia. Alas! what could
a poor little dog do to defend her? But he ran
forward and barked at the men and bit their
heels, until at last they chased him away with
heavy blows. And then he lay down outside the
palace-door, determined to watch and see what
had become of Zelia.</p>

<p>Conscience pricked him now. &#8220;What!&#8221; he
thought, &#8220;I am furious against these wicked
men, who are carrying her away; and did I not
do the same myself? Did I not cast her into
prison, and intend to sell her as a slave? Who
knows how much more wickedness I might not
have done to her and others, if Heaven&#8217;s justice
had not stopped me in time?&#8221;</p>

<p>While he lay thinking and repenting, he heard
a window open, and saw Zelia throw out of it
a bit of dainty meat. Chéri, who felt hungry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
enough by this time, was just about to eat it,
when the woman to whom he had given his crust
snatched him up in her arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor little beast!&#8221; cried she, patting him,
&#8220;every bit of food in that palace is poisoned;
you shall not touch a morsel.&#8221;</p>

<p>And at the same time the voice in the air repeated
again, &#8220;Good actions never go unrewarded.&#8221;
And Chéri found himself changed into
a beautiful little white pigeon. He remembered
with joy that white was the colour of the Fairy
Candide, and began to hope that she was taking
him into favour again.</p>

<p>So he stretched his wings, delighted that he
might now have a chance of approaching his fair
Zelia. He flew up to the palace windows, and,
finding one of them open, entered and sought
everywhere, but he could not find Zelia. Then,
in despair, he flew out again, resolved to go over
the world until he beheld her once more.</p>

<p>He took flight at once, and traversed many
countries, swiftly as a bird can, but found no
trace of his beloved. At length in a desert, sitting
beside an old hermit in his cave and partaking
with him of his frugal repast, Chéri saw a poor
peasant girl and recognized Zelia. Transported
with joy, he flew in, perched on her shoulder, and
expressed his delight and affection by a thousand
caresses.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>She, charmed with the pretty little pigeon,
caressed it in her turn, and promised it that,
if it would stay with her, she would love it
always.</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you done, Zelia?&#8221; said the hermit,
smiling. And while he spoke the white pigeon vanished,
and there stood Prince Chéri in his own
natural form. &#8220;Your enchantment ended, Prince,
when Zelia promised to love you. Indeed, she
has loved you always, but your many faults constrained
her to hide her love. These are now
amended, and you may both live happy if you
will, because your union is founded upon mutual
esteem.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chéri and Zelia threw themselves at the feet of
the hermit, whose form also began to change.
His soiled garments became of dazzling whiteness,
and his long beard and withered face grew into
the flowing hair and lovely countenance of Fairy
Candide.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rise up, my children,&#8221; said she; &#8220;I must now
transport you to your palace, and restore to Prince
Chéri his father&#8217;s crown, of which he is now
worthy.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had scarcely ceased speaking when they
found themselves in the chamber of Suliman, who,
delighted to find again his beloved pupil and
master, willingly resigned the throne, and became
the most faithful of his subjects.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>King Chéri and Queen Zelia reigned together
for many years, and it is said that the former was
so blameless and strict in all his duties that,
though he constantly wore the ring which Candide
had restored to him, it never once pricked his
finger enough to make it bleed.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">TOADS AND DIAMONDS</h4></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time there was a widow who had
two daughters. The elder was so exactly like her
mother in disposition and in face that whoever
saw one, saw the other. They were both so disagreeable
and so proud that nobody could endure
them.</p>

<p>The younger was the image of her dead father.
She was sweet and kind-hearted, besides being
very beautiful. While her mother loved the elder
daughter to distraction, she hated the younger.
The poor child had to eat in the kitchen, and work
day and night. And twice every day she had to
walk several miles to a distant fountain to fetch
home a large pitcher of water.</p>

<p>One morning, while she was resting beside the
fountain, a poor woman passing by, stopped and
asked her for a drink.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed!&#8221; said the obliging young girl.
And immediately dipping her pitcher, she filled it
where the water was coldest, and held it carefully
up so that the woman might easily drink
from it.</p>

<p>When the woman had finished drinking, she
said: &#8220;You are so beautiful, so good, and so kind,
that I must bestow a gift upon you. For every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
word that you speak, there shall fall from your
lips either a flower or a jewel.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now the woman was not really a poor peasant,
but a Fairy who had taken that form in order to
find how kind-hearted the young girl was. She
then vanished.</p>

<p>As soon as the daughter arrived at home, her
mother scolded her for being absent so long.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon, my mother, for being
gone such a long time,&#8221; answered the girl. And
as she spoke there fell from her lips three roses,
three lilies, three pearls, and three large diamonds.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do I see!&#8221; exclaimed her mother in
amazement. &#8220;Where did you get them, my
child?&#8221; It was the first time in her life that she
had ever called her &#8220;my child.&#8221; &#8220;I do believe
those jewels came from your mouth!&#8221;</p>

<p>The poor girl told her in a few words what had
happened, and while she was talking a shower of
blossoms and gems fell to the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Truly!&#8221; exclaimed the mother; &#8220;I must send
my darling there! Look!&#8221; called she to the elder
daughter; &#8220;see what comes out of your sister&#8217;s
mouth. Would you not be glad to have the same
Fairy gifts? You have only to go and draw
some water from the fountain, and when a poor
woman asks for a drink to give it to her very
politely.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>&#8220;It would certainly look fine for me to carry a
great pitcher to the fountain!&#8221; answered the elder
daughter angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you to go there at once,&#8221; said her
mother.</p>

<p>So the girl went, but grumbling. She took the
prettiest silver pitcher that there was in the
house; and she was no sooner arrived at the fountain
than she saw, stepping out of the wood, a
magnificent lady attired in rich robes. She approached
the girl and asked her for a drink. It
was the same Fairy who had appeared to her sister,
but who had taken the form of a Princess in
order to find how rude the girl would be.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, indeed!&#8221; answered the insolent girl; &#8220;do
you think that I am come here on purpose to
give you a drink? I suppose you think that I
have brought a silver pitcher expressly to draw
water for you! Draw the water yourself, my fine
lady!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are rude,&#8221; replied the Fairy without becoming
in the least angry. &#8220;Since you are so utterly
disobliging, I bestow on you a gift. It is
this, for every word that you speak, there shall fall
from your mouth either a viper or a toad.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the Fairy vanished.</p>

<p>When her mother saw the girl returning, she
cried out: &#8220;Well, my daughter!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, my mother!&#8221; snapped the hateful girl,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
and as she spoke there sprang from her mouth
two snakes and one toad.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do I see!&#8221; shrieked her mother. &#8220;Your
sister is the cause of this, and she shall pay for it!&#8221;</p>

<p>And she rushed to beat the poor child, who fled
into the neighbouring wood. The son of the King
was returning from the chase, and met her as she
was running away. Seeing how beautiful she was,
he asked her why she was there alone, and why
she wept.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, sir,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it is because my mother
has driven me from home.&#8221;</p>

<p>The King&#8217;s son, seeing five or six pearls and as
many diamonds fall from her lips, begged her to
explain how such a marvel could be. When she
told him about the Fairy&#8217;s gift, he thought that
such a wedding portion was more than he could
expect with a Princess, so he led the girl to his
palace, and married her.</p>

<p>As for the sister, she made herself so hated, and
so many vipers and toads sprang from her mouth,
that at last her mother drove her from home. And,
after having been refused shelter by all the neighbours,
she died in a dark corner of the wood.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">BLANCHE AND ROSE</h4></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time there was a poor widow, who
had two charming daughters. She named the
elder Blanche, and the younger Rose, because
they had the most beautiful complexions in the
world.</p>

<p>One day, while the mother sat spinning at the
door of her cottage, she saw a poor, bent, old
woman hobbling by on a crutch. She pitied her,
and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very tired. Sit down a minute and
rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she called her daughters to fetch a chair.
They both hastened, but Rose ran faster than her
sister and brought it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you not have a drink?&#8221; asked the mother
kindly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, I will,&#8221; replied the old woman. &#8220;And
it seems to me that I could eat a morsel, too, if
you will give me something to strengthen me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will gladly give you all that I have,&#8221; said the
mother, &#8220;but as I am poor, it will not be much.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she bade her daughters wait on the old
woman, who had seated herself at the table. She
told Blanche to go and pick some plums from the
plum tree that Blanche herself had planted, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
of which she was very proud. But instead of obeying
her mother pleasantly, she went away grumbling,
and thinking, &#8220;What a shame that I have
taken such care of my tree just for this greedy
old woman!&#8221; However, she did not dare refuse
to fetch some plums, and she brought them with
a very bad grace, and evidently much against her
will.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you, Rose,&#8221; said the mother, &#8220;you have
no fruit to give this good lady, for your grapes are
not yet ripe!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is true,&#8221; answered Rose, &#8220;but I hear
my hen cackling. She has just laid an egg, and I
will give that with all my heart!&#8221;</p>

<p>And without allowing the old woman time to
speak, Rose ran out to seek the egg. But when
she came back the old woman had disappeared,
and in her place stood the most beautiful lady&mdash;a
Fairy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good woman,&#8221; said she to the mother, &#8220;I am
about to reward your two daughters as they deserve.
The elder shall become a great Queen, and
the younger shall be a farmer&#8217;s wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the lady waved a wand and in a twinkling
the little cottage was changed into a pretty farmhouse
surrounded by a flourishing farm.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is your wedding portion,&#8221; said she to
Rose. &#8220;I know I am giving to each of you what
you like best.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>So saying the Fairy disappeared, leaving the
mother and daughters speechless with surprise
and joy. They were delighted with the spotlessness
of all the furniture. The chairs were of wood,
but they were so well polished that they shone
like mirrors. The beds were covered with linen
as white as snow. In the stables there were twenty
sheep, as many lambs, four oxen, four cows; and
in the yard were chickens, ducks, and pigeons.
There was also a pretty garden full of fruits and
flowers.</p>

<p>Blanche saw without jealousy all that the Fairy
had given her sister. She was taken up with the
thought of the delightful times she should have
when she became a Queen. Just then a party of
royal hunters passed by. And while she stood in
the door to look at them, she appeared so wonderfully
beautiful in the eyes of the King that he
determined to marry her.</p>

<p>After she became Queen, she said to Rose: &#8220;I do
not wish you to be a farmer&#8217;s wife. Come with
me, sister, and I will wed you to a great lord.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am much obliged to you, my sister,&#8221; answered
Rose, &#8220;but I am used to the country, and
wish always to remain here.&#8221;</p>

<p>During the first months of her marriage Queen
Blanche was so occupied with fine clothes, balls,
and the theatre, that she thought of nothing else.
But afterward she became accustomed to the gay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
doings of the Court, and nothing amused her. On
the contrary, she had many troubles.</p>

<p>At first the courtiers paid her great deference,
but she knew that when she was not present, they
said to each other: &#8220;See how this little peasant
puts on the airs of a fine lady! The King must
have very low taste to choose such a wife!&#8221;</p>

<p>Talk like this came to the King, and he began
to think that he had made a mistake in marrying
Blanche, so he ceased to love her, and neglected
her sadly. When the courtiers saw this, they no
longer did her honour. She had not one true
friend to whom she might confide her sorrows.
She always had a doctor near her who examined
her food and took away everything she liked. They
put no salt in her soups. She was forbidden to
walk when she wished to. In a word, she was interfered
with from morning to night. The King
took her children from her, and gave them in
charge of governesses who brought them up badly.
But the Queen dared not say a word.</p>

<p>Poor Blanche! She was dying of grief. She became
so thin that everybody pitied her. She had
not seen her sister for several years, because she
thought that it would disgrace a Queen to visit
a farmer&#8217;s wife. But now feeling herself so unhappy,
she asked the King&#8217;s permission to pass a
few days in the country. He gladly gave his consent,
for he was delighted to be rid of her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>When she arrived in the evening at the home of
Rose, a band of shepherds and shepherdesses were
dancing gaily on the grass. &#8220;There was a time,&#8221;
sighed Blanche, &#8220;when I amused myself like these
simple people! Then there was no one to prevent
it!&#8221;</p>

<p>While she was thinking thus, her sister ran to
embrace her, looking so happy and plump that
Blanche could not help weeping as she gazed at her.</p>

<p>Rose had married a young farmer, who loved
her dearly; and together they managed the farm
that was the Fairy&#8217;s marriage portion. Rose had
not many servants, but those she had she treated
so kindly that they were as devoted to her as if
they were her children. Her neighbours, too,
were so fond of her that they were always trying
to show it. She had not much money, but she had
no need of it, for her farm produced wheat, wine,
and oil; her flocks furnished milk; and she made
butter and cheese. She spun the wool of her sheep
into clothing for her household, all of whom enjoyed
the best of health. When the day&#8217;s work
was done, the whole family amused themselves
with games, music, and dancing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alas!&#8221; cried Queen Blanche, &#8220;the Fairy made
me but a sad gift when she gave me a crown!
People do not find happiness in magnificent palaces,
but in the simple joys and labour of the
country!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>As she finished speaking, the Fairy herself appeared
before her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not intend to reward you by making you
a Queen,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but to punish you because
you gave your plums with such bad grace. In
order to be truly happy it is necessary to possess,
like your sister, only those things that are simple
and joyful, and not to wish for more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, madame!&#8221; cried Blanche, &#8220;you are sufficiently
avenged! Pray put an end to my misery!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is ended,&#8221; replied the Fairy. &#8220;Even now
the King, who has ceased to love you, is sending
his officers to forbid your returning to the palace.&#8221;</p>

<p>All happened as the Fairy had said. And Blanche
passed the rest of her life with Rose. She was
happy and contented, never even thinking of the
royal Court, except when she thanked the Fairy
for taking her from it, and bringing her back to the
pretty farm and to her dear sister.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">THE ENCHANTED WATCH</h4></div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> once lived a gay young girl named Fannie,
who never knew what time it was. Did she care?
That I cannot say. And it is impossible for me to
tell you how often she kept her father waiting, and
caused him to be late for his appointments. And
such a kind father as he was to Fannie, for she was
his only child and he loved her very much. Indeed,
he loved her so much that he overlooked her
faults when he should have reproved them. Whole
half-hours she used to keep the carriage waiting
in front of the door, while she prinked before her
mirror. And because she was never prompt, every
one called her &#8220;Miss Tardy.&#8221; Yet, after keeping
people waiting, she would excuse herself in the
sweetest manner possible, and blame herself for
thoughtlessness.</p>

<p>One day her old Godmother wrote that she was
coming the next morning to lunch with Fannie
at noon. She was a Fairy so celebrated for her
promptness that people called her &#8220;the Fairy
Prompt,&#8221; of which name she was very proud.
With her, <i>noon</i> was not ten minutes after twelve,
nor ten minutes before twelve, but it was <i>exactly
twelve o&#8217;clock</i>.</p>

<p>So the next morning, at the first stroke of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
twelve, she set her foot on the bottom step of
Fannie&#8217;s house, and, as the last stroke died away,
she entered the dining-room. The table was beautifully
laid, and all was ready, but Fannie was not
there. Indeed, Miss Tardy had forgotten all about
her Godmother, and was calling on a friend. She
was trying on her friend&#8217;s beautiful new clothes
and having such a fine time that the Godmother
was utterly forgotten, as if she had never been in
the world.</p>

<p>But at last hunger reminded Fannie of luncheon,
and she hurried home. The servants informed her
that her Godmother had arrived, but as Fannie&#8217;s
shoes pinched her, she rushed to her room and
put on a pretty little pair of slippers. Then, as her
street clothes were not suitable for slippers, she
changed her dress for a becoming house-gown.
By this time it was two o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>She found her Godmother asleep in a comfortable
chair, such as is not made any more; and,
I think, she was snoring a little. She awoke as
Fannie opened the door hurriedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Godmother,&#8221; said she, &#8220;I am so
sorry!&mdash;so ashamed!&mdash;I am indeed a thoughtless
creature to keep you waiting this way!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is all right,&#8221; said the Godmother, who
was very kind and indulgent to Fannie. &#8220;I have
slept a little, while waiting for you. That will do
me no harm. What time is it?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, please do not ask me!&#8221; begged Fannie,
&#8220;you will make me die with shame!&#8221;</p>

<p>And like a playful child she ran and stood in
front of the clock, but her Fairy Godmother, who
had good eyes, saw that the hand had passed two
o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>The dinner, as you may well imagine, was overdone,
but the Fairy, who really loved her goddaughter,
took it all as good-naturedly as possible,
and made many gay jokes as she tried to eat the
burnt roasts and the scorched creams.</p>

<p>It was soon four o&#8217;clock, and Fannie&#8217;s father
hurriedly entered the drawing-room, where she
was chatting with her Godmother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Fannie!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Are you ready?
Are you ready?&#8221; Then he started back when he
saw his daughter, in her pretty pink and blue
house-gown, stretched indolently on a sofa, her
feet to the fire, while she daintily sipped her
coffee.</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; exclaimed her father. &#8220;Have you
forgotten that you were to be ready at four
o&#8217;clock!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you not see my Godmother with me,
Papa?&#8221; said Fannie reproachfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me, madame,&#8221; said the father, turning
to the Fairy and bowing, although his face
was red with anger. &#8220;Excuse my rudeness, but
my daughter will cause me to die with grief!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>&#8220;And what has the poor child done?&#8221; asked
the Godmother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Judge for yourself,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Prince Pandolph
has invited us to his villa. Fannie is to
sing for his guests. They are all assembled and
expecting her. The Prince has sent his carriage
which is now waiting before the door.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Papa,&#8221; said Fannie, &#8220;cannot you go
without me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know that cannot be, child,&#8221; said her
father sadly. &#8220;It is you who are invited, and it
is your fine voice that the Prince wishes for his
musicale. He will now be offended for ever,
since you cannot go in this dress.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Calm yourself, my good sir,&#8221; said the Godmother,
seeing Fannie&#8217;s confusion. &#8220;It is because
of me that this dear little one has forgotten you.
It is for me to repair this evil.&#8221;</p>

<p>So saying she passed her hand over the unfortunate
house-gown and it was instantly transformed
into the most ravishing robe embroidered
with gold and pearls. Fannie, who was naturally
very pretty, shone like a star in this brilliant
costume.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a minute,&#8221; said the Fairy to the impatient
father, who was already leading his daughter
away. &#8220;Let me finish my work.&#8221; And she put
around the neck of her goddaughter a magnificent
golden chain at the end of which hung an exquisite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
little watch the size of a locket, and all of
chased gold studded with diamonds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, little one,&#8221; said she, kissing the forehead
of the spoilt child, &#8220;here is something that
will aid your naughty memory. With this you will
never again forget an engagement. Be sure to
come home by ten o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, indeed!&#8221; said Fannie, kissing her
Godmother joyfully.</p>

<p>It is necessary to say here that it was the Fairy
Prompt who invented watches in her youth. But
hers were not like those sold nowadays in the
shops. There was a magic virtue in each watch,
for when the hour of an engagement arrived, it
made so loud a ticking that the owner of it had
no peace until he kept his engagement.</p>

<p>So it happened that while Fannie was listening
to the praises of the Prince and his guests, who
were saying that she had the most delightful voice
in the world, she heard a gentle sound, but very
distinct:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Tic! Tic! Tic!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is ten o&#8217;clock!&#8221; exclaimed Fannie joyously
to her father. &#8220;Oh! my dear, good, little watch,
that my Godmother gave me, it has told me so!
We must hurry home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her father, who was very much pleased because
she had charmed the Prince and his guests with
her sweet voice, said as they drove away:&mdash;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>&#8220;My dear child, to-morrow I am going to take
you to the finest jeweller in town, and buy for
you the bracelet of antique cameos that you
have been begging me for. At what time do you
wish to go? At ten o&#8217;clock?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; cried Fannie, her eyes sparkling
with delight, &#8220;at nine o&#8217;clock, please! Ever since
I saw the bracelet I have been dying to possess
it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good! At nine o&#8217;clock, then. And what
shall we do with the rest of our morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At exactly ten I am to go to the dressmaker&#8217;s
to order some new gowns,&#8221; said Fannie, &#8220;but
may we not lunch together at eleven?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as you say, dear little nightingale,&#8221;
answered her father affectionately. &#8220;And order
all the gowns and furbelows you wish, for the
plumage should match the warbling. And since
it suits you, I will meet you promptly at eleven,
for at twelve I have an important business engagement.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At eleven o&#8217;clock, then, dear Papa,&#8221; said
Fannie, &#8220;but do not forget to return in time this
evening to escort me to the Baron&#8217;s ball!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry!&#8221; said her father, smiling, &#8220;for
nothing in the world would I make a pearl of a
daughter like you wait for an escort!&#8221;</p>

<p>The next morning Fannie rose early and
dressed more rapidly than usual, and was ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
waiting for her father at nine. They drove to the
jeweller&#8217;s. How her eyes sparkled as her father
clasped the cameo bracelet on her arm! But the
jeweller, who hoped to sell Fannie a necklace as
well, took from his showcase such beautiful collars
of pearls, rubies, amethysts, and other gems
and precious stones that she forgot how the time
was flying.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Tic! Tic! Tic! Tic!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, dear watch, for warning me!&#8221;
said Fannie gaily, &#8220;but the dressmaker must
wait!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Tic! Tic! Tic! Tic! Tic!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You insupportable thing!&#8221; cried she, and
taking the watch from her neck she handed it
to her father, saying: &#8220;I beg you, dear Papa, to
put this in your pocket. It is very annoying!&#8221;</p>

<p>He took the watch, and seeing a friend on the
street, went to the door to speak with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Toc! Toc! Toc! Toc!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>The watch raised its voice so that Fannie
should hear it. The people in the shop all asked
where the noise came from. And her father, mortified,
said good-bye to his friend, gave back the
watch to Fannie, and hurried her into the carriage.</p>

<p>She was soon at the dressmaker&#8217;s, and her ill-humour
passed as she ordered a dress of pink brocade
trimmed with rich lace, and a robe of garnet
velvet embroidered with gold threads, and a cloak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
of silver cloth trimmed with pearls. She was not
yet through when she glanced at the clock, and
saw that it was eleven.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; thought she, &#8220;that horrid watch is
going to disturb me again! But I&#8217;ll finish my
ordering!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Toc! Toc! Toc! Toc!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>The dressmaker turned her head. &#8220;What&#8217;s
that, Miss?&#8221; she exclaimed with fright.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is nothing, let us go on!&#8221; said Miss Tardy.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Toc! Toc! Toc! Toc!</i>&#8221; louder than before.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is thieves! It is thieves!&#8221; cried the dressmaker.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is nothing I tell you&mdash;unfold this gown.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Toc!&mdash;Toc!&mdash;Toc!&mdash;Toc!</i>&#8221; louder and
louder!</p>

<p>And the poor dressmaker, half dead with fright,
was in such a state that she could show no more
clothes. And Fannie put on her hat and coat, and
hurried away to the restaurant where she found
her father walking nervously up and down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! how thoughtful of you, dear child, to be
prompt!&#8221; he said, as he led her to a table. And
the delicious food soon made her forget her annoyance.</p>

<p>When Fannie returned home she was so fatigued
that she put on a charming wrapper, and
lay down to rest. Then she remembered that she
had an engagement to see a poor man at two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
o&#8217;clock, whose want she had promised to relieve.
She took the fatal watch from her neck, and
giving it to the maid, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take this, and carry it to the cellar, so that
I may be rid of it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Two o&#8217;clock struck, and the poor old man,
who had had nothing to eat for three days, presented
himself. The maid told him that Miss
Fannie was sleeping and would not see him. With
tears streaming down his cheeks, he bowed
humbly and was turning away, when everybody
in the house jumped to the ceiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Paf! Paf! Paf! Paf!</i>&#8221; It was like so many
shots from a pistol.</p>

<p>The neighbours commenced screaming. The
servants ran frantically to and fro.</p>

<p>Fannie sprang up from her couch.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Paf! Paf! Paf! Paf!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be that wretched watch!&#8221; cried she.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Paf!&mdash;Paf!&mdash;Paf!&mdash;Paf!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes! Yes! I am coming! I am coming!&#8221;
And she hurried to the cellar and, picking up the
watch, returned to her room in silence.</p>

<p>Then she called the poor old man, fed him, and
comforted him, and sent him away with a full
purse.</p>

<p>Evening arrived, and Fannie, all dressed for the
Baron&#8217;s ball, shone more beautifully than ever
in her magnificent gown. And just as her father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
was leading her to the carriage, a clumsy wagon
drove up, and an old countrywoman descended
from it, crying out that she must see her dear
child&mdash;her Fannie&mdash;just once more before
she died. It was Fannie&#8217;s old nurse who had come
all the way from her village miles distant to hold
her dear child in her arms. When she saw that
Fannie was ready to go out, she screamed loudly
and would have made herself ill, if Fannie had
not embraced her tenderly, and promised to return
before midnight. On the strength of this
promise the old woman grew calm, and Fannie
and her father went away to the ball.</p>

<p>But as the carriage drove through the streets,
Fannie regretted her promise, and slipping her
little hand under her cloak, she loosened the
fatal watch, and flung it into a deep ditch.</p>

<p>&#8220;At last! At last!&#8221; she said to herself, with a
sigh of relief.</p>

<p>Midnight sounded, and found her breathlessly
twirling around in the dance, her eyes sparkling
and her cheeks glowing.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>The orchestra stopped suddenly. The thunderclaps&mdash;for
so they seemed to be&mdash;continued to
follow each other without interruption.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>All the city was awake. Women cried out that
the end of the world was come.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>The unfortunate Fannie knew in a minute
what it was. Fright seized her, and she lost her
head. Instead of returning home quietly, which
would have put an end to the horrible racket,
she ran out into the street, and, wild with fright,
hastened with all speed to the spot where she had
thrown the watch.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Boom! Boom!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>The houses were lighted. The amazed people
thrust their heads out the windows. All that
they saw was a young girl running through the
streets, her neck and head bare, and her ball-gown
flying in the wind.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Boom! Boom!</i>&#8221;&mdash;every stroke was louder and
more fearful.</p>

<p>The firemen came hurrying up to see if there
was a fire, and one of them held his lantern under
Fannie&#8217;s nose, and cried out: &#8220;Why, it is little
Miss Tardy! She has doubtless lost the time, and
is hunting for it! Ha! Ha!&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile Fannie ran on, and arrived breathlessly
at the ditch into which she had flung the
watch. Guided by its thunderous blows, she
quickly laid her fingers on it. In a fury she was
about to dash it against a stone when she felt a
hand on her arm.</p>

<p>It was her Fairy Godmother, who, in gentle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
tones of reproach, said: &#8220;What are you doing,
my child? You can never succeed!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she took the watch from Fannie, which
instantly became quiet, and passed the chain
around the neck of her goddaughter, who was
trembling with penitence and shame.</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither violence nor trickery,&#8221; said her Godmother,
&#8220;have any power over my gift to you.
All you can do is to take it, and obey. And then
you will find yourself happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the same moment Miss Tardy felt herself
being transported through the air, and found herself
once more in her own room, holding the hand
of her old nurse, who was weeping with tenderness
and joy.</p>

<p>I have no need to tell you that Fannie never
again attempted to disobey the protecting tyrant
that she wore around her neck. And as the watch
no longer had to warn her with its loud ticking,
she learned in time to enjoy sacrificing her whims
to her duty.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">FAIRY DO-NOTHING AND GIANT
SNAP-&#8217;EM-UP</h4></div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the days of yore there lived a very idle, greedy,
naughty boy such as we never hear of in these
times. His name was Master No-Book. The
young gentleman hated lessons like mustard,
both of which brought tears to his eyes. And
during school hours he sat gazing at his books,
pretending to be busy, while he considered where
he could get the nicest pies, pastries, ices, and jellies.
He smacked his lips at the very thought of
them.</p>

<p>Whenever Master No-Book spoke, it was to
ask for a piece of cake, or an apple, or a bit of
plum pudding. Indeed, very frequently when
he did not get permission to eat the goodies, this
naughty glutton helped himself without leave.</p>

<p>One afternoon Master No-Book, having played
truant from school, was lolling on his mamma&#8217;s
best sofa, with his leather boots tucked up on the
satin cushions, and nothing to do but to suck a
few oranges, and nothing to think of but how
much sugar to put into them, when suddenly an
event took place which filled him with astonishment.</p>

<p>A sound of soft music stole into the room, becoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
louder and louder, the longer he listened,
till at length a large hole burst open in the wall
of the room. Then there stepped into his presence
two magnificent Fairies, just arrived from
their castles in the air, to pay him a visit. They
had travelled all the way on purpose to talk with
Master No-Book.</p>

<p>The Fairy Do-Nothing was gorgeously dressed
with a wreath of flames round her head, a robe
of gold tissue, a necklace of rubies, and a bouquet
of glittering diamonds in her hand. Her
teeth were gold, her hair was of the most brilliant
purple, and her eyes were green. In fact she was
a most fine and fashionable Fairy.</p>

<p>The Fairy Teach-All, who followed next, was
simply dressed in white muslin, with bunches of
natural flowers in her brown hair; and she carried
a few, neat, small books, which made Master
No-Book shudder.</p>

<p>The two Fairies now informed him that they
very often invited large parties of children to
spend some time at their palaces. Therefore they
had now come to invite Master No-Book, but
as they lived in opposite directions, he would
have to choose which he would visit first.</p>

<p>&#8220;In my house,&#8221; said the Fairy Teach-All,
speaking with a very sweet smile, and a soft,
pleasing voice, &#8220;my young friends rise at seven
every morning, and amuse themselves with working<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
in a beautiful garden of flowers, raising fruits
of all kinds, visiting the poor, playing together,
and learning to know the world they live in and
how to fulfill the purposes for which they have
been brought into it. In short, all our amusements
tend to some useful object; and you will
grow wiser, better, and happier every day you
remain in the Palace of Knowledge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But in the Castle Needless, where I live,&#8221;
interrupted the Fairy Do-Nothing, rudely pushing
her companion aside, &#8220;we never think of
working. No one is ever asked a question. We
lead the most fashionable life imaginable. Each
of my visitors sits with his back to as many of the
company as possible, and whenever he can, he
sits in the most comfortable chair. If he takes
the trouble to wish for anything, he gets it.
Clothes are provided of the most magnificent
kinds, which go on by themselves without buttons
or strings. Delicious dishes are served smoking
hot under his nose, at all hours, while any rain
that falls is of lemonade, chocolate, and cider.
And in Winter it generally snows ice-cream and
tutti-frutti, for an hour during the forenoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nobody need be told which Fairy Master No-Book
preferred. And quite charmed at his good
fortune in receiving such a delightful invitation,
he eagerly gave his hand to his splendid new
acquaintance, who promised him so much pleasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
and ease. He gladly proceeded with her in a
carriage lined with velvet, stuffed with downy
pillows, and drawn by milk-white swans, to that
magnificent residence, Castle Needless, which
was lighted by a thousand windows during the
day and by a million lamps at night.</p>

<p>Here Master No-Book enjoyed a constant holiday
and a continual feast. A beautiful lady, covered
with jewels, was ready to tell him stories
from morning till night. Servants waited to pick
up his playthings if they fell, and to draw out
his purse or pocket handkerchief when he wished
to use them.</p>

<p>Thus Master No-Book lay dozing for hours
and days on richly embroidered cushions, never
stirring from his place in the garden, but admiring
the view of trees covered with the richest burnt
almonds, the grottoes of sugar-candy, a fountain
of lemonade, and a bright clear pond filled with
goldfish that let themselves be caught.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more complete, yet strange
to say Master No-Book did not seem particularly
happy. Every day he became more peevish.
No sweetmeats were worth the trouble of
eating, no game was pleasant to play, and he
wished that it were possible to sleep all day as
well as night.</p>

<p>Not a hundred miles from the Fairy Do-Nothing&#8217;s
palace, there lived a cruel monster called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
the Giant Snap-&#8217;Em-Up. When he stood erect,
he looked like the tall steeple of a great church.
He raised his head so high that he could peep
over the loftiest mountains; and he was obliged
to climb a ladder to comb his own hair.</p>

<p>Every morning this prodigiously great Giant
walked round the world before breakfast, looking
for something to eat. He lived in fine style, and
his dinners were most magnificent, consisting of
an elephant roasted whole, ostrich patties, a tiger
smothered in onions, stewed lions, and whale
soup. But for a side dish, his favourite of all consisted
of little boys, as fat as possible, fried in
crumbs of bread with plenty of pepper and salt.</p>

<p>No children were so well-fed or in such good
condition for eating as those in the Fairy Do-Nothing&#8217;s
garden, who was a particular friend
of the Giant Snap-&#8217;Em-Up. She oftentimes
laughingly said that she gave him permission to
help himself, whenever he pleased, to as many of
her visitors as he chose. And in return for such
civility the Giant often invited her to dinner.</p>

<p>One day, when Master No-Book felt even more
lazy, more idle, more miserable than ever, he lay
beside a perfect mountain of toys and cakes,
wondering what to wish for next, and hating the
very sight of everything and everybody. At last
he gave so loud a yawn of weariness and disgust,
and he sighed so deeply, that the Giant Snap-&#8217;Em-Up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
heard the sounds as he passed along the
road before breakfast.</p>

<p>Instantly he stepped into the garden to see
what was the matter. On observing a large,
fat, overgrown boy, as round as a dumpling,
lying on a bed of roses, he gave a cry of delight,
followed by a gigantic peal of laughter which was
heard three miles off.</p>

<p>Picking up Master No-Book between his finger
and thumb, with a pinch that nearly broke
his ribs, he carried him rapidly toward his own
castle; while the Fairy Do-Nothing laughingly
shook her head as he passed, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;That little man does me great credit! He has
been fed only for a week, and is as fat already
as a prize ox! What a dainty morsel he will be!
When do you dine, my friend Snap-&#8217;Em-Up,
in case I should have time to look in upon
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>On reaching home the Giant immediately
hung up Master No-Book by the hair of his head
on a prodigious hook in the larder. Then he
went away to look for more little boys.</p>

<p>There, in torture of mind and body&mdash;like a
fish on a hook&mdash;the wretched Master No-Book
began to reflect seriously on his former ways,
and to consider what a happy home he might
have had if he had been satisfied to go to school
and study with the other boys.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>In the midst of these sad reflections, Master
No-Book&#8217;s attention was attracted by the sound
of many voices laughing, talking, and singing,
which caused him to turn his eyes and look out
of the larder window. For the first time he observed
that the Fairy Teach-All&#8217;s garden lay
upon a beautiful sloping bank not far away.</p>

<p>There a crowd of merry, noisy, rosy-cheeked
boys were busily employed, and seemed happier
than the day was long. Poor Master No-Book
watched them, envying the enjoyment with
which they raked the flower-borders, gathered
fruit, carried baskets of vegetables to the poor,
worked with carpenters&#8217; tools, drew pictures,
shot with bows and arrows, and played ball.
Then they sat in sunny arbours learning their
lessons, till, the dinner-bell having been rung, the
whole party sat down to a feast of roast meat,
apple-pie, and other good wholesome things.
The Fairy Teach-All presided, and helped her
guests to as much as was good for them.</p>

<p>Large tears rolled down the cheeks of Master
No-Book while watching this scene, and remembering
that if he had known what was best for
him, he might have been as happy as the happiest
of these excellent boys, instead of being about
to suffer a most miserable death.</p>

<p>Now, as the Giant Snap-&#8217;Em-Up wished a nice
dish of fried boys for dinner, and as there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
plenty of time, he seized a large basket in his
hand, and set off at a rapid pace toward the Fairy
Teach-All&#8217;s garden. It was very seldom that
Snap-&#8217;Em-Up ventured to forage there, as he
had never once succeeded in carrying off a single
captive from that garden, it was so well fortified
and so bravely defended. But on this occasion,
being desperately hungry, he felt bold as a
lion, and walked with outstretched hands straight
toward the Fairy Teach-All&#8217;s dinner-table, taking
such huge strides that he seemed almost to trample
on himself.</p>

<p>A cry of consternation arose the minute this
tremendous Giant appeared. And as usual, as
when on such occasions he had made the same
attempt before, a dreadful battle took place.
Fifty active little boys flew upon the enemy with
their dinner knives, and like a nest of hornets,
stung him in every direction, till he roared with
pain, and would have run away; but the Fairy
Teach-All rushed forward, and cut off his head
with the carving-knife.</p>

<p>If a great mountain had fallen to the earth, it
would have seemed like nothing in comparison
with the Giant Snap-&#8217;Em-Up, who crushed houses
to powder under him. But the greatest event
which occurred was the death of the Fairy Do-Nothing,
who had been looking on at this battle,
and who was too lazy to run away. When the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
Giant fell, his sword came with so violent a stroke
on her head that she instantly expired.</p>

<p>The Fairy Teach-All, seeing the enemy dead,
hastened to the Giant&#8217;s Castle, and lost no time
in liberating Master No-Book from his hook
in the larder.</p>

<p>From this very hour, Master No-Book became
the most diligent, active, happy boy in the Fairy
Teach-All&#8217;s garden. And on returning home
a few months afterward, he astonished all his
teachers at school by his wisdom and studiousness.
He scarcely ever stirred without a book
in his hand, never lay on a sofa again, and preferred
a three-legged stool to a comfortable
chair with a back. He detested holidays, and
never ate a morsel of food till he had worked
very hard and got an appetite.</p>

<p>When he grew up, he was known as Sir Timothy
Bluestocking. And though generally very
good-natured and agreeable, Sir Timothy was
occasionally to be seen in a violent passion, laying
around him with his walking-stick, and beating
little boys within an inch of their lives. It
invariably appeared that he had found them to
be lazy, idle, or greedy.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">TIMOTHY TUTTLE AND THE
LITTLE IMPS</h4></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Timothy Tuttle, Esquire,</span> was reclining on his
soft, comfortable sofa. The gas-light flashed
brilliantly over the rich rug and rosewood furniture,
and fell softly on the velvet-seated chairs
and heavy curtains. It was a mild evening in
June, and the cool air came refreshingly in, while
the bright light flashed gaily out the windows.</p>

<p>Timothy Tuttle, Esquire, one of the richest
merchants in the city, was reposing after the
fatigues of the day. He was thinking how very
good and respectable he was, and of his success
in life, of his great wealth, and especially of his
ships now in the China seas, which were bringing
him even more wealth. Then he thought of his
plans for a fine new mansion, and how he would
now be able to purchase many costly things for
his home. Very soon he grew weary, and fell
asleep.</p>

<p>Suddenly he awoke and heard something moving
over the rug, and turning his head to see what
it was, beheld a dozen or more of the strangest
little creatures capering about. They were like
little Imps in human form, but winged and not
higher than Timothy&#8217;s knee. They were coal-black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
from head to foot, and were moving around
with grace and agility.</p>

<p>Timothy Tuttle was a brave man, but he was
very much startled to see this unexpected sight.
For as soon as the little Imps perceived that he
was awake, they began to bow to him in quick
succession, more and more rapidly, and all the
time grinning and showing their white teeth from
ear to ear.</p>

<p>Then Timothy Tuttle heard something squeak
close to his head, and saw one of the little creatures
sitting on the arm of the sofa and mowing
at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid, Timothy, it&#8217;s only I!&#8221; it
squeaked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who on earth are you,&#8221; asked Timothy, &#8220;and
what do you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>This question seemed to amuse all the little fellows
hugely, for they began to bow again, grinning
and capering in fine style, and crying out:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you do, Timothy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are very glad to see you, Timothy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid, Timothy, we&#8217;re all here!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad of that!&#8221; exclaimed Timothy; &#8220;I&#8217;m
glad that there are no more of you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Plenty more! Plenty more, Timothy!&#8221; they
cried, laughing and holding their sides. &#8220;But
we&#8217;ll do, Timothy! We&#8217;ll do! Oh, yes, we&#8217;ll do!
We&#8217;ll do!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>Timothy Tuttle was no coward, but he could
not help feeling somewhat frightened as he looked
at their antics; and he gazed around to see where
they could have come in. The door was locked,
and only the window was open.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want? Go away! Go away!&#8221;
he cried, in a husky voice.</p>

<p>The little Imps grinned all the more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dee-lighted to see you, Timothy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Flattering reception, Timothy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be happy to stay, Timothy!&#8221;</p>

<p>And with that they began to bow again with
great politeness.</p>

<p>Timothy looked about for some weapon of defence,
but saw nothing within reach.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; he demanded again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Want you, Timothy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Must come with us, Timothy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where to?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>At that all the little Imps pointed over their
shoulders with their thumbs, to the open window.</p>

<p>Timothy reflected that, as he was in the second
story of the house, any attempt to go out by the
window, without wings, would be preposterous.
He drew his hand across his eyes to make sure
that he was not asleep; then he looked again, and
there were all the little Imps bowing more politely
than ever. He seized a pillow, and was
about to throw it at them, when they flew at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
him, dragged the pillow out of his hands, overpowered
him, and picking him up by the arms and
legs, flew out of the window, carrying him off
bodily.</p>

<p>How far he was carried Timothy Tuttle never
knew, but it seemed to him a very long distance.
When he found himself again at liberty, he was
lying on the bare ground in the cold moonlight.
He sprang up, and saw all the little Imps standing
in a circle around him, bowing and nodding with
great good-humour.</p>

<p>He looked about. He found himself on an
open plain, surrounded by forests. Nothing was
in sight except a very large Gothic building in the
centre of the plain. It was old, but a larger and
more magnificent building Timothy had never
seen. Its pointed roof rose to the skies, and
stained-glass windows adorned its gray stone
walls. The turrets and towers were beautifully
carved, and the walls were hung here and there
with green ivy. But the building was falling into
decay. Some of the windows were broken, and
some of the stones crumbling to ruin. A few of
the arches were fallen, and the roof threatened
to cave in.</p>

<p>Timothy Tuttle turned from surveying this
building, to look at his grinning companions.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re wanted, Timothy!&#8221; cried one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; he asked hoarsely.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>They all pointed over their shoulders with
their thumbs at the great door of the building.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what if I will not go?&#8221; he asked, in as
cool and determined a voice as he could assume.</p>

<p>At this all the little Imps began to caper about
in great glee, singing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;<i>Mortals rash</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Who disobey,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Little Imps</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Will bear away!</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>If they still</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Refuse to go,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>If they dare</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>To answer, &#8216;No!&#8217;</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Take a pin,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>And stick it in!</i>&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>At that instant Timothy Tuttle felt a sharp pain
in one of his legs, and he could not help crying out.
He knew that there was nothing to do but to
obey, so he turned and walked toward the building,
while the quick patter of tiny feet and the
flutter of wings told him that the little Imps were
close behind.</p>

<p>Only once did he turn his head, and his ears
were greeted with:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, Timothy! We&#8217;re all here!&#8221;</p>

<p>When Timothy had entered the door, he found
that the interior of the building was one great
room. Around its sides were galleries rising tier
above tier, and under the galleries were recesses
and alcoves; still, it was all one room.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>From the centre of the arched ceiling hung a
splendid chandelier, with a thousand lamps. But
most of the lights were extinguished, and the few
that were burning, flickered and smoked so badly
that the building was dimly lighted.</p>

<p>When Timothy first entered, his ears were
filled with a hissing and fluttering sound, and
after he had been there long enough to become
used to the dim light, he saw that the whole building
was full of just such little Imps as had brought
him hither. They were flying up and down, and
flitting to and fro, and seemed very busy. Looking
up, he saw four or five large windows through
which some appeared to fly away, while others
would dart through into the building with great
swiftness, just as bees come and go from the hive.
But the most astonishing part of it all was their
extraordinary politeness to Timothy, and the
grinning that showed on all sides as he entered.</p>

<p>Now, as we have said before, Timothy Tuttle
was no coward, and, stepping up to one of the
little Imps who had just flown in, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to know me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, Timothy!&#8221; replied the little fellow,
nodding violently. &#8220;Yes! I know you! I know
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, where do you all go to out those windows?
And where do you come from?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve just been to China!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>Timothy looked as if he did not believe him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve just been to the China seas, on
board your ships, and I have been counting your
wealth.&#8221; And the little wretch winked fast and
knowingly.</p>

<p>Timothy was dumb. He remembered what he
had been thinking when he fell asleep.</p>

<p>His grinning companion left him, and he wandered
about the great edifice, where he saw a
large number of little Imps busily at work. Some
were painting the wall with small brushes. It was
amazing to see how rapidly they could sketch a
picture.</p>

<p>Timothy watched them for a moment, and
fairly held his breath when he saw one by one
past scenes of his own life start out upon the
wall. Many of the scenes he had thought that
no one knew of but himself. But here one or another
of his deeds, good and bad, was drawn to
the very life upon the wall! And as they worked,
the little fellows grinned and sang, but Timothy
could not understand what they said.</p>

<p>Timothy turned away from these grinning
little creatures, and moved to where another
group were sketching other pictures. He was almost
afraid to look at the pictures, but when he
did so, he saw that the painters were making
designs too ugly and horrid to look at. But Timothy
was perplexed, for of all the pictures there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
was none that he did not think he had seen <i>somewhere</i>
before. And these little Imps were singing
the same song that the others were singing, and
Timothy thought that he caught the refrain:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;<i>Bad little,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Sad little,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Mad little</i></div>
<div class="indent2"><i>Thoughts!</i>&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Here he turned to look into the recesses and
alcoves under the galleries. Not all the inhabitants
of the edifice were like the little creatures
who had brought him hither. Oh, no! In the
shadows of the great pillars there lurked and
crawled great slimy things that made one shudder
to see. Enormous spiders, larger than any
Timothy had ever dreamed of, ran swiftly across
the floor. Centipedes and lizards clung to the
mouldy walls, and cold, slippery serpents glided
noiselessly along. Occasionally he came upon
huge shapeless creatures who lay curled upon the
floor, staring at him with watery eyes.</p>

<p>Timothy hastily picked his way out into the
light again. Here he found other groups of
painters. One group was using brighter colours
and blending them beautifully. But he could
scarcely believe his own eyes when he saw the
picture of the fine mansion he was planning, and
the images of a thousand other things he had
wished and hoped for.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>But the painters in the next group were acting
very strangely. They touched their brushes to
the wall hastily and tremblingly, glancing over
their shoulders as if in terror. And though their
pictures did not assume any definite form, Timothy
felt most uneasy. There he saw the dim
outline of another world of which he had heard,
but had forgotten to think of for many years.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Timothy had reached the upper
end of the room, and found himself close to a
great curtain tightly drawn. On either side of
it he beheld a marble basin. One of the basins
had evidently contained a fountain, but it was
now half choked with mud, and only a little water
oozed out of it. On looking into the other, he
was astonished to find it full of liquid fire.</p>

<p>Just then he heard behind the curtain the
sound as of a mighty rushing wind, and at the
same moment the two fountains boiled up and
cast out their dirt, and this they continued to
do until each basin was brimming full, one of
pure water and the other of pure fire.</p>

<p>The little Imps, too, heard the sound. At first
they were awed and hushed; then they began to
fly about in confusion until Timothy was bewildered
by the noise and movement.</p>

<p>Suddenly the curtain was parted, and Timothy
saw a stately Lady seated upon a throne
in a noble arched recess. Her head was thrown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
back, her eyes flashed, and in her hand she
held a scourge every thong of which seemed
to writhe and twist and end in little snappers
of fire.</p>

<p>At the sight of this scourge and the frown on
the Lady&#8217;s face, all the little Imps began to howl
dismally. The Lady arose, and came down from
her throne into the centre of the room, and the
little Imps fled before her. But they could not
escape. Seizing the first one she met, she plunged
him several times into the basin of water. Then
taking him out, she carried him kicking and
quivering to the other basin, and plunged him
into the fire. Timothy stood horror-stricken. He
leaned against a pillar to support himself, but
what was his astonishment to see the Lady take
the little fellow out of the basin, and release him;
and he ran away unharmed. But a strange thing
had happened. The little Imp was no longer so
black, and instead of grinning maliciously, he
was now smiling as pleasantly as possible.</p>

<p>The Lady seized every little Imp in the room,
in the same manner, and plunged him into both
basins. Then she collected troops of the Imps,
and drove them before her with the fiery scourge.
She made them begin to scrape the dirt off the
floor, and down from the walls, to repair the broken
places in the roof, and to polish the rusty
and musty spots. And all the rubbish she made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
them throw into the basin full of pure fire. Sometimes
two or three little Imps would carry one of
the great slimy reptiles, and drop him in, and all
those thus dropped into the fire never came out
again.</p>

<p>And as the little Imps worked, they broke into
a song:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;<i>All the rubbish</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Thither take!</i></div>

<p>Timothy watched and listened until he became
very weary; then he stretched himself out on the
floor and fell asleep.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>When he awoke, he found himself lying in a
dazzling light. How long he had been asleep he
did not know. He sprang to his feet with an
agility and ease that he had never felt before. He
looked about him. There was still the same great
room, the same chandelier with its thousand
lamps, the same pattering of little feet and rustling
of wings! But, oh, how changed! How changed!</p>

<p>The arched roof was composed of transparent
pearl, delicately carved, and fretted with lines
of brilliant rose-diamonds. Pendants hung from
the arches, formed of great diamonds and pearls
cut into exquisite shapes. The walls were of ruby
and topaz, and sparkled with mosaics of precious
gems, representing scenes more beautiful than
any ever seen on earth. The huge pillars were of
jasper and around them was twined the graceful
immortal amaranth. The floor was of coloured
marble, inlaid with onyx and amethyst.</p>

<p>In the noble recess at the end of the room, sat
the Lady on a throne carved from ivory and
studded with diamonds. Her scourge and frown
had disappeared, and from her smiling countenance
shone a divine beauty.</p>

<p>The chandelier, every lamp of which was now
pouring out a silver light, sent a glowing radiance
into the farthest corners and recesses under
the galleries, and revealed no signs of stain or
shadow. The basins threw high their spray of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
sparkling water and pure fire, looking like fountains
of liquid light, which fell back again with
the softest music.</p>

<p>But the greatest change of all was in the little
Imps. They were each and all of a purer transparency
of white than anything Timothy had
ever conceived. And there was not one upon
whose face did not play a smile of joy. Some of
them were working harder than ever, while others
were bathing in the fountains, darting and fluttering
in and out of the spray. They looked as
light and brilliant as soap-bubbles in the sun,
and flashing from their wings were all the colours
of the rainbow. Indeed, the little Imps shone so
brightly that Timothy could scarcely look at them.</p>

<p>But while he was examining all these wonderful
changes with admiration, he heard a silver
trumpet ring through the edifice. And as its
sweet notes died away among the pearl arches,
the little Imps with myriad voices, as sweet and
clear as the trumpet-call, sang:&mdash;</p>

<p>Then the most amazing thing of all happened.
Timothy Tuttle, Esquire, suddenly found himself
lying once more on the soft, comfortable sofa
in his own home. The gas-light was flashing over
the rich rug and rosewood furniture, just as it
had done when he had last seen the room. He
raised himself on his elbow and looked around,
but not one of the little Imps was there. Indeed,
he could find no traces of them except the marks
of their tiny black feet on the rug.</p>

<p>But from that day forward Timothy was a
changed man. His face was no longer hard
and selfish, but it beamed with good and kind
thoughts. He no longer preferred wealth to
everything else in the world. He gave up the
plan for his fine new mansion&mdash;indeed, he no
longer wished for one&mdash;and he spent the remainder
of his days making his family and
friends happy, and relieving the poor and needy.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">BUTTERFLY&#8217;S DIAMOND</h4></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time there was a little Fairy who
was remarkable for her impatience and laziness.
She was called Fairy Butterfly because she had
such splendid green wings with silver spots on
them. She loved dearly to be dressed in gorgeous
colours, and to sleep in the rich chambers of the
Foxgloves, or to flutter over beds of fragrant
Mignonette. In truth, she was as luxurious a
little Fairy as the sun ever shone on. So much
did she like her ease that she would not gather a
single dew-drop to bathe her face, nor would
she pick a fresh rose-petal for a napkin. She
played all day long, or slept curled up in the heart
of a flower. Oh, she was a lazy Fairy!</p>

<p>When the Queen of the Fairies observed the
faults of Butterfly, she resolved to help her to
correct them. One day she summoned the lazy
one to Court, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fairy Butterfly, we command you to go at
once to the Green Cavern in the Island of Ceylon,
and remain there until you have fashioned
a diamond more pure and brilliant than any that
has ever rested on the brow of mortal or Elf.&#8221;</p>

<p>Little Butterfly bowed in silence and withdrew.
As soon as she was outside the green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
mound in which the Fairy Queen held her Court,
she burst into a passionate flood of tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall have to watch that diamond for
months and months and years and years,&#8221;
sobbed she, &#8220;and every day I must turn it over
with my wand so that the crystals will form
evenly! Oh, it is an endless labour to make a
diamond! Oh, I am a most wretched Fairy!&#8221;</p>

<p>So she sat, and sobbed, and murmured for
several minutes. Then she jumped up and
stamped her little feet on the ground so furiously
that the blue-eyed grasses trembled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t bear it!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;I&#8217;ll run
away to the Fairies of the Air. I am sure they
will be so pleased with my beauty that they will
feed me, and I shall never need to work again! As
for the diamond, why, it is just impossible for a
little Fairy like me to make it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she peeped into a fountain to admire
herself, and saw, alas! that the splendid green of
her wings had faded, and the silver spots were
dim. For, if Fairies have naughty thoughts,
their wings always droop and their beauty fades.
At this sight, little Butterfly wept aloud with
vexation and shame.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose the old tyrant, our Queen, thinks
that now I am so ugly, I&#8217;ll hide myself in the
Green Cavern in the Island of Ceylon! But I&#8217;ll
let her see that I do not care about her!&#8221; And,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
alas! as Butterfly spoke thus, the silver spots disappeared
entirely, and her wings became a dirty
brown.</p>

<p>Trembling with anger, the little one waved her
wand, and called:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;<i>Hummingbird! Hummingbird!</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Come nigh! Come nigh!</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>And carry me off</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>To the far Blue Sky!</i>&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>In an instant a tiny hummingbird, shining like
a jewel, alighted at her feet. She sprang on his
back, and away they flew to the golden clouds in
the West where the Queen of the Air Fairies
held her Court. And when the Queen and all
her Fairies saw Butterfly&#8217;s dirty brown wings,
they waved their wands and vanished. And little
Butterfly was left alone in the Palace of the Air.</p>

<p>But such a beautiful palace as it was! The
clouds hung around it like transparent curtains
of opal. The floor was paved with a rainbow.
Thousands of gorgeous birds fluttered in the sunlight,
and a multitude of voices filled the place
with sweet sounds. Butterfly, fatigued by her
flight through the sky and lulled by the voices,
lay down on a rosy cloud, and fell into a gentle
slumber.</p>

<p>When she awoke, she saw that a tiny bird,
smaller than the hummingbird, was building a
nest beside her. Straw after straw, shred after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
shred, the patient little creature brought in her
bill and wove together. And then she flew away
over hills and fields to find soft down with which
to line the nest.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is a foolish thing!&#8221; murmured Butterfly.
&#8220;How hard she works, and I don&#8217;t believe that
she will finish it after all!&#8221;</p>

<p>But soon the bird came back with her bill full
of down, and lined the soft warm nest so that
it was fit for a Fairy to sleep in. Butterfly
peeped into it, and exclaimed, &#8220;Oh, what a pretty
thing!&#8221;</p>

<p>Immediately she heard the tinkling of a lute,
and a clear voice singing:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;<i>Bit by bit the bird builds her nest!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>She started up, and the Queen of the Air
Fairies stood before her, clad in a robe of azure
gossamer, embroidered with rainbow lights.</p>

<p>&#8220;Foolish Butterfly,&#8221; said she, &#8220;we allow no
idlers here. Obey your Queen, and go at once to
the Green Cavern in the Island of Ceylon. Time
and patience will accomplish all things. Go and
make your diamond, and then you shall be welcome
here.&#8221; Butterfly tried to tell her how very
hard it was to make a diamond, but the Queen
of the Air Fairies flew away, touching her lute,
and singing:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;<i>Bit by bit the bird builds her nest!</i>&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>Butterfly leaned her head upon her hands for
a minute. She began to be ashamed of being so
lazy, but she did not yet wish to go to the lonely
Green Cavern, and work hard. So she waved her
wand, and called again:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;<i>Hummingbird! Hummingbird!</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Come nigh! Come nigh!</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>And carry me back</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Through the clear Blue Sky!</i>&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Immediately the little hummingbird returned,
and she sprang on his back. He flew down with
her, and she alighted near the green mound inside
of which the Fairy Queen held her Court.</p>

<p>Close by the mound Butterfly saw some bees
working in a crystal hive. Wearily and sadly she
watched them. They left the hive, dipped into
flowers, and carried their loads of sweet pollen
back to the hive, and there they built their wax
combs filled with golden honey. &#8220;I wish,&#8221;
thought she, &#8220;that I loved to work as hard as
the bees do! But as for that diamond, it is useless
to think about it! I should never finish it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then she heard strains of delightful music
coming from the mound, and a chorus of Fairy
voices singing:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;<i>Little by little the bee builds its cell!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Butterfly could have wept when she heard
those familiar voices, for she longed to be with
her Fairy sisters dancing hand-in-hand. &#8220;I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
make the diamond,&#8221; murmured she. &#8220;I shall
surely get it done sometime! And I can fly home
every night and dance in the Fairy Ring, or sleep
in the flowers!&#8221;</p>

<p>Immediately a joyful strain of music rose on
the air, and she heard her sisters&#8217; voices singing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;<i>To the Green Cavern haste away!</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Sleep by night, and work by day!</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Little by little the gem will grow,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Till pure as sunshine it will glow!</i>&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Alas! when Butterfly heard this, instead of
flying at once to the Green Cavern, she began
to think how hard she should have to work, and
how many times she must turn the diamond. &#8220;I
never can do it!&#8221; thought she. &#8220;I will go to the
Queen of the Ocean Fairies. I am sure she will
let me live in her Sea-Palace; and I need never
work again!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mournful notes came from the mound, as
Butterfly turned toward the seashore. When she
reached the beach, she waved her wand, and
called:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;<i>Nautilus! Nautilus!</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Come to me</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>And carry me through</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>The cold green Sea!</i>&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Immediately the delicate pearly boat of the
nautilus came floating over the Ocean, and a
wave landed it at Butterfly&#8217;s feet. She stepped in,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
and down, down, under the waves she went, down
to the bed of the Ocean, to a coral grove. And
there was the magnificent palace of the Queen
of the Ocean Fairies. Its pink coral pillars were
twisted into a thousand beautiful forms. Pearls
hung in deep festoons from the arches. The fan-coral
and the sea-moss were formed into deep,
cool bowers. And the hard, sandy floor was covered
with many-coloured shells.</p>

<p>But as it had been in the Air, so it was in the
Sea! When the Queen of the Ocean Fairies saw
Butterfly&#8217;s dirty brown wings, she and all her
Court waved their wands and disappeared. And
Butterfly was left alone in the Sea-Palace.</p>

<p>&#8220;How beautiful it is!&#8221; cried she. &#8220;Giants
must have made these coral pillars!&#8221; As she
spoke her eyes were nearly blinded by a swarm of
tiny insects, and she saw them rest on an unfinished
coral pillar. While she looked and wondered,
she heard a thousand shell-trumpets being
blown, and many voices singing:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;<i>Mite by mite the insect builds the coral bower!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>The sounds drew nearer and nearer, and a hundred
Fairies, standing in beautiful shells, came
floating through the water. In the largest shell
of all was their Queen in a robe of wave-coloured
silk spun by the Ocean silkworm. It was as thin
as a spider&#8217;s web, and the border was gracefully
wrought with seed pearls.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>&#8220;Foolish Butterfly,&#8221; said the Queen, &#8220;learn
to be industrious. We allow no idlers at our
Court. Look at the coral pillars of my palace.
They were made by these swarms of little creatures.
Labour and patience did it all.&#8221;</p>

<p>And she waved her wand, and the hundred
shells floated away, while all the Fairies sang:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;<i>Mite by mite the insect builds the coral bower!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; said Butterfly, sighing. &#8220;All creatures
are busy, on the earth, in the air, and under
the water. All things seem happy at their work.
Perhaps I can learn to be so, too. I will make the
diamond. And it shall be as pure and brilliant as
a sunbeam in a water-drop!&#8221;</p>

<p>So Butterfly sought the Green Cavern in the
Island of Ceylon. Day by day she worked as
busily as the coral insects. She grew cheerful
and happy. Her wings once more became a
splendid green, and the silver spots were so
bright that they seemed like sparks of fire. Never
had she been so beautiful, never so much loved
by the little birds and flowers.</p>

<p>After seven years had passed by, Butterfly
knelt at the feet of her Queen and offered her
diamond. It gave light like a star, and the whole
Fairy Mound shone with its rays. And to this
day the Fairies call it &#8220;Butterfly&#8217;s Diamond.&#8221;</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">LITTLE NIEBLA</h4></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Have</span> you seen the white mist over the River
Yi in the morning&mdash;a light white mist that flies
away when the sun gets hot? Yes? Then I will
tell you a story about the white mist and a little
girl named Alma.</p>

<p>Little Alma lived close to the River Yi, but
far, far from here, beyond the trees and beyond
the blue hills, for the Yi is a very long river. She
lived with her grandmother and with six uncles,
all big, tall men with long beards, and they always
talked about wars, and cattle, and a great many
other important things that Alma could not
understand. There was no one to talk to Alma
and for Alma to talk to or to play with. And
when she went out of the house where all the big
people were talking, she heard the cocks crowing,
the dogs barking, the birds singing, the sheep
bleating, and the trees rustling their leaves over
her head, and she could not understand one word
of all they said. At last, having no one to play
with or talk to, she sat down and began to cry.</p>

<p>Now, it happened that near the spot where she
sat there was an old black woman wearing a red
shawl, who was gathering sticks for the fire, and
she asked Alma why she cried.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>&#8220;Because I have no one to talk to and play
with,&#8221; said Alma.</p>

<p>Then the old black woman drew a long brass
pin out of her shawl, and pricked Alma&#8217;s tongue
with it, for she made Alma hold it out to be
pricked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said the old woman, &#8220;you can go and
play and talk with the dogs, cats, birds, and
trees, for you will understand all they say, and
they will understand all you say.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alma was very glad, and ran home as fast as
she could to talk to the cat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, cat, let us talk and play together,&#8221;
she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; said the cat. &#8220;I am very busy
watching a little bird, so you must go away and
play with little Niebla down by the river.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the cat ran away among the weeds and
left her. The dogs also refused to play when she
went to them, for they had to watch the house
and bark at strangers. Then they also told her to
go and play with little Niebla down by the river.</p>

<p>Then Alma ran out, and caught a little duckling,
a soft little thing, that looked like a ball of
yellow cotton, and said: &#8220;Now, little duck, let
us talk and play.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the duckling only struggled to get away,
and screamed: &#8220;Oh, Mamma! Mamma! Come
and take me away from Alma!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>Then the old duck came rushing up, and said:
&#8220;Alma, let my child alone; and if you want to
play, go and play with Niebla down by the river.
A nice thing to catch my duckie in your hands&mdash;what
next, I wonder!&#8221;</p>

<p>So she let the duckling go, and at last she said,
&#8220;Yes, I will go and play with Niebla down by
the river.&#8221;</p>

<p>She waited till she saw the white mist, and
then ran all the way to the Yi, and stood still on
the green bank close by the water with the white
mist all round her.</p>

<p>By and by she saw a beautiful little child come
flying toward her in the white mist. The child
came and stood on the green bank, and looked at
Alma. Very, very pretty she was; and she wore
a white dress&mdash;whiter than milk, whiter than
foam, and all embroidered with purple flowers.
She had also white silk stockings and scarlet
shoes, bright as scarlet verbenas. Her hair was
long and fluffy, and shone like gold, and round
her neck she had a string of big, gold beads.</p>

<p>Then Alma said, &#8220;Oh, beautiful little girl, what
is your name?&#8221;</p>

<p>To which the little girl answered: &#8220;Niebla.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you talk to me, and play with me?&#8221; said
Alma.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; said Niebla; &#8220;how can I play with a
little girl dressed as you are, and with bare feet?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>For, you know, poor Alma only wore a little
old frock that came down to her knees, and she
had no shoes and stockings on.</p>

<p>Then little Niebla rose up and floated away,
away from the bank and down the river. And
at last, when she was quite out of sight in the
white mist, Alma began to cry. When it got very
hot, she went and sat down, still crying, under
the trees. There were two very big willow trees
growing near the river. By and by the leaves
rustled in the wind, and the trees began talking
to each other, and Alma understood everything
they said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you got any nests in your branches?&#8221;
said one tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, one,&#8221; said the other tree. &#8220;It was made
by a little yellow bird, and there are five speckled
eggs in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the first tree said: &#8220;There is little Alma
sitting in our shade. Do you know why she is
crying, Neighbour?&#8221;</p>

<p>The other tree answered: &#8220;Yes, it is because
she has no one to play with. Little Niebla by
the river refused to play with her because she is
not beautifully dressed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the first tree said: &#8220;Ah, she ought to go
and ask the fox for some pretty clothes to wear.
The fox always keeps a great store of pretty
things in her hole.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>Alma had listened to every word of this conversation.
She remembered that a fox lived on
the hillside not far off; for she had often seen it
sitting in the sunshine, with its little ones playing
round it and pulling their mother&#8217;s tail in
fun.</p>

<p>So Alma got up, and ran till she found the hole,
and putting her head down it, she cried out:
&#8220;Fox! Fox!&#8221;</p>

<p>But the fox seemed cross, and only answered,
without coming out, &#8220;Go away, Alma, and talk
to little Niebla. I am busy getting dinner for
my children, and have no time to talk to you
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Alma cried: &#8220;Oh, Fox, Niebla will not
play with me because I have no pretty things
to wear! Oh, Fox, will you give me a nice
dress, and shoes and stockings, and a string of
beads?&#8221;</p>

<p>After a little while the fox came out of its hole
with a big bundle done up in a red cotton handkerchief,
and said: &#8220;Here are the things, Alma,
and I hope they will fit you. But, you know,
Alma, you really ought not to come at this time
of day, for I am very busy just now cooking
the dinner&mdash;an armadillo roasted and a couple
of partridges stewed with rice, and a little omelette
of turkeys&#8217; eggs&mdash;I mean plovers&#8217; eggs,
of course; I never touch turkeys&#8217; eggs.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>Alma said she was very sorry to give so much
trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, never mind,&#8221; said the fox. &#8220;How is your
grandmother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is very well, thank you,&#8221; said Alma, &#8220;but
she has a bad headache.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very sorry to hear it,&#8221; said the fox.
&#8220;Tell her to stick two fresh dock-leaves on her
temples, and on no account to go out in the hot
sun. Give her my best respects. And now, run
home, Alma, and try on the things, and when
you are passing this way, you can bring me back
the handkerchief, as I always tie my face up in
it when I have the toothache.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alma thanked the fox very much, and ran
home as fast as she could; and when the bundle
was opened she found in it a beautiful white
dress embroidered with purple flowers, a pair of
scarlet shoes, silk stockings, and a string of great
golden beads.</p>

<p>They all fitted her very well; and next day,
when the white mist was on the Yi, she dressed
herself in her beautiful clothes, and went down
to the river. By and by little Niebla came flying
along; and when she saw Alma, she came and
kissed her, and took her by the hand. All the
morning they played and talked together, gathering
flowers and running races over the green
sward. And, at last, Niebla bade her good-bye,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
and flew away, for all the white mist was floating
off down the river.</p>

<p>But every day after that, Alma found her little
companion by the Yi, and was very happy, for
now she had some one to talk to and to play
with.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">LITTLE TINY</h4></div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was once a woman who wished very much
to have a little child; so she went to a Fairy, and
said: &#8220;I should so very much like to have a little
child. Can you tell me where I may find one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that is easily managed,&#8221; said the Fairy.
&#8220;Here is a barley-corn of a different kind to
those which grow in the farmers&#8217; fields, and which
the chickens eat. Put it into a flower-pot, and
see what will happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said the woman, and she gave
the Fairy twelve shillings, which was the price
of the barley-corn. Then she went home and
planted it, and immediately there grew up a
large handsome flower, something like a tulip in
appearance, but with its leaves tightly closed as
if it was still a bud.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a beautiful flower,&#8221; said the woman,
and she kissed the red and golden-coloured leaves,
and while she did so the flower opened, and she
could see that it was a real tulip.</p>

<p>Within the flower, upon the green velvet stamens,
sat a very delicate and graceful little
maiden. She was scarcely half as long as a
thumb, and they gave her the name of &#8220;Little
Thumb,&#8221; or Tiny, because she was so small. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
walnut-shell, elegantly polished, served her for
a cradle. Her bed was formed of blue violet-leaves,
with a rose-leaf for a counterpane.</p>

<p>Here she slept at night, but during the day
she amused herself on a table, where the woman
had placed a plateful of water. Round this plate
were wreaths of flowers with their stems in the
water, and upon it floated a large tulip-leaf,
which served Tiny for a boat. Here the little
maiden sat and rowed herself from side to side,
with two oars made of white horse-hair. It really
was a very pretty sight. Tiny could, also, sing
so softly and sweetly that nothing like her singing
had ever before been heard.</p>

<p>One night, while she lay in her pretty bed, a
large, ugly, wet toad crept through a broken
pane of glass in the window, and leaped right
up on the table where Tiny lay sleeping under her
rose-leaf quilt.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a pretty little wife this would make
for my son!&#8221; said the toad, and she took up the
walnut-shell in which little Tiny lay asleep, and
jumped through the window with it into the
garden.</p>

<p>In the swampy margin of a broad stream in
the garden lived the toad, with her son. He was
uglier even than his mother, and when he saw
the pretty little maiden in her elegant bed, he
could only cry: &#8220;<i>Croak, croak, croak</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t speak so loud, or she will wake,&#8221; said
the toad, &#8220;and then she might run away, for she
is as light as swan&#8217;s down. We will place her on
one of the water-lily leaves out in the stream. It
will be like an island to her, she is so light and
small, and then she cannot escape. And, while
she is away, we will make haste and prepare the
state-room under the marsh, in which you are to
live when you are married.&#8221;</p>

<p>Far out in the stream grew a number of water-lilies,
with broad green leaves, which seemed to
float on the top of the water. The largest of
these leaves appeared farther off than the rest,
and the old toad swam out to it with the walnut-shell,
in which little Tiny lay still asleep.</p>

<p>The little creature woke very early in the
morning, and began to cry bitterly when she
found where she was, for she could see nothing
but water on every side of the large green leaf,
and no way of reaching the land.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the old toad was very busy under
the marsh, decking her room with rushes and wild
yellow flowers, to make it look pretty for her
new daughter-in-law. Then she swam out with
her ugly son to the leaf on which she had placed
poor little Tiny. She wanted to fetch the pretty
bed, that she might put it in the bridal chamber
to be ready for her.</p>

<p>The old toad bowed low to her in the water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
and said: &#8220;Here is my son. He will be your husband,
and you will live happily together in the
marsh by the stream.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Croak, croak, croak</i>,&#8221; was all her son could
say for himself. So the toad took up the elegant
little bed, and swam away with it, leaving Tiny
all alone on the green leaf, where she sat and
wept. She could not bear to think of living with
the old toad, and having her ugly son for a husband.</p>

<p>The little fishes, who swam about in the water,
had seen the toad, and heard what she said, so
they lifted their heads above the water to look
at the little maiden. As soon as they caught sight
of her, they saw she was very pretty, and it made
them sorry to think that she must go and live
with the ugly toads. &#8220;No, it must never be!&#8221;
so they assembled together in the water, round
the green stalk which held the leaf on which the
little maiden stood, and gnawed it away at the
root with their teeth. Then the leaf floated
down the stream, carrying Tiny far away.</p>

<p>Tiny sailed past many towns, and the little
birds in the bushes saw her, and sang: &#8220;What a
lovely little creature!&#8221; So the leaf swam away
with her farther and farther, till it brought her
to other lands. A graceful little white butterfly
constantly fluttered round her, and at last
alighted on the leaf. Tiny pleased him, and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
was glad of it, for now the toad could not possibly
reach her, and the country through which
she sailed was beautiful, and the sun shone upon
the water, till it glittered like liquid gold. She
took off her girdle and tied one end of it round
the butterfly, and the other end of the ribbon she
fastened to the leaf, which now glided on much
faster than ever, taking little Tiny with it as she
stood.</p>

<p>Presently a large cockchafer flew by. The
moment he caught sight of her, he seized her
round her delicate waist with his claws, and flew
with her into a tree. The green leaf floated away
on the brook, and the butterfly flew with it, for
he was fastened to it, and could not get away.</p>

<p>Oh, how frightened little Tiny felt when the
cockchafer flew with her to the tree! But especially
was she sorry for the beautiful white
butterfly which she had fastened to the leaf, for
if he could not free himself he would die of hunger.
But the cockchafer did not trouble himself
at all about the matter. He seated himself by
her side on a large green leaf, gave her some honey
from the flowers to eat, and told her she was very
pretty, though not in the least like a cockchafer.
After a time, all the cockchafers who lived in the
tree came to visit her. They stared at Tiny,
and then the young lady-cockchafers turned up
their feelers, and said: &#8220;She has only two legs!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
how ugly that looks.&#8221; &#8220;She has no feelers,&#8221; said
another. &#8220;Her waist is quite slim. Pooh! she is
like a human being.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! she is ugly!&#8221; said all the lady-cockchafers,
although Tiny was very pretty. Then the cockchafer
who had run away with her, believed all
the others when they said she was ugly, and
would have nothing more to say to her, and told
her she might go where she liked. Then he flew
down with her from the tree, and placed her
on a daisy, and she wept at the thought that she
was so ugly that even the cockchafers would
have nothing to say to her. And all the while she
was really the loveliest creature that one could
imagine, and as tender and delicate as a beautiful
rose-leaf!</p>

<p>During the whole summer poor little Tiny
lived quite alone in the wide forest. She wove
herself a bed with blades of grass, and hung it up
under a broad leaf, to protect herself from the
rain. She sucked the honey from the flowers for
food, and drank the dew from their leaves every
morning. So passed away the Summer and the
Autumn, and then came the Winter,&mdash;the long,
cold Winter.</p>

<p>All the birds who had sung to her so sweetly
were flown away, and the trees and the flowers
had withered. The large clover leaf under the
shelter of which she had lived, was now rolled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
together and shrivelled up, nothing remained
but a yellow withered stalk. She felt dreadfully
cold, for her clothes were torn, and she was herself
so frail and delicate, that, poor little thing,
she was nearly frozen to death! It began to snow
too; and the snow-flakes, as they fell upon her,
were like a whole shovelful falling upon one of
us, for we are tall, but she was only an inch high.
Then she wrapped herself up in a dry leaf, but
it cracked in the middle and could not keep her
warm, and she shivered with cold.</p>

<p>Near the wood in which she had been living
lay a large corn-field, but the corn had been cut
a long time; nothing remained but the bare dry
stubble standing up out of the frozen ground. It
was to her like struggling through a large wood.
Oh! how she shivered with the cold. She came
at last to the door of a field-mouse, who had a
little den under the corn-stubble. There dwelt
the field-mouse in warmth and comfort, with a
whole roomful of corn, a kitchen, and a beautiful
dining-room. Poor little Tiny stood before
the door just like a little beggar-girl, and begged
for a small piece of barley-corn, for she had been
without a morsel to eat for two days.</p>

<p>&#8220;You poor little creature,&#8221; said the field-mouse,
who was really a good old field-mouse,
&#8220;come into my warm room and dine with me.&#8221;
She was very pleased with Tiny, so she said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
&#8220;You are quite welcome to stay with me all the
Winter, if you like; but you must keep my rooms
clean and neat, and tell me stories, for I shall
like to hear them very much.&#8221; And Tiny did
all the field-mouse asked her, and found herself
very comfortable.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall have a visitor soon,&#8221; said the field-mouse
one day. &#8220;My neighbour pays me a visit
once a week. He is better off than I am. He has
large rooms, and wears a beautiful black velvet
coat. If you could only have him for a husband,
you would be well provided for indeed! But he
is blind, so you must tell him some of your prettiest
stories.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Tiny did not feel at all interested about
this neighbour, for he was a mole. However, he
came and paid his visit, dressed in his black velvet
coat.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is very rich and learned, and his house is
twenty times larger than mine,&#8221; said the field-mouse.</p>

<p>He was rich and learned, no doubt, but he
always spoke slightingly of the sun and the
pretty flowers, because he had never seen them.
Tiny was obliged to sing to him: &#8220;Lady-bird,
lady-bird, fly away home,&#8221; and many other pretty
songs. And the mole fell in love with her because
she had such a sweet voice. But he said nothing
yet, for he was very cautious.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>A short time before, the mole had dug a long
passage under the earth, which led from the dwelling
of the field-mouse to his own, and here she
had permission to walk with Tiny whenever she
liked. But he warned them not to be alarmed at
the sight of a dead bird which lay in the passage.
It was a perfect bird, with a beak and feathers,
and could not have been dead long, and was lying
just where the mole had made his passage.</p>

<p>The mole took a piece of phosphorescent wood
in his mouth, and it glittered like fire in the dark.
Then he went before them to light them through
the long, dark passage. When they came to the
spot where lay the dead bird, the mole pushed
his broad nose through the ceiling, the earth
gave way, so that there was a large hole, and the
daylight shone into the passage.</p>

<p>In the middle of the floor lay the dead swallow,
his beautiful wings pulled close to his sides,
his feet and his head drawn up under his feathers.
The poor bird had evidently died of the cold.
It made little Tiny very sad to see it, she did so
love the little birds. All the Summer they had
sung and twittered for her so beautifully.</p>

<p>But the mole pushed it aside with his crooked
legs, and said: &#8220;He will sing no more now. How
miserable it must be to be born a little bird! I
am thankful that none of my children will ever be
birds, for they can do nothing but cry, &#8216;Tweet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
tweet,&#8217; and always die of hunger in the Winter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you may well say that, you clever man!&#8221;
exclaimed the field-mouse. &#8220;What is the use of
his twittering, for when Winter comes he must
either starve or be frozen to death. Still, birds
are very high-bred.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tiny said nothing; but when the others had
turned their backs on the bird, she stooped down
and stroked aside the soft feathers which covered
the head, and kissed the closed eyelids. &#8220;Perhaps
this was the one who sang to me so sweetly
in the Summer,&#8221; she said; &#8220;and how much pleasure
it gave me, you dear, pretty bird.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mole now stopped up the hole through
which the daylight shone, and then accompanied
Tiny and the field-mouse home.</p>

<p>But during the night Tiny could not sleep; so
she got out of bed and wove a large, beautiful
carpet of hay. Then she carried it to the dead
bird, and spread it over him, with some down
from the flowers which she had found in the field-mouse&#8217;s
room. The down was as soft as wool, and
she spread some of it on each side of the bird,
so that he might lie warmly in the cold earth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Farewell, you pretty little bird!&#8221; said she,
&#8220;farewell! Thank you for your delightful singing
during the Summer, when all the trees were
green, and the warm sun shone upon us.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>Then she laid her head on the bird&#8217;s breast, but
she was alarmed immediately, for it seemed as if
something inside the bird went &#8220;<i>thump, thump</i>.&#8221;
It was the bird&#8217;s heart! He was not really dead,
only benumbed with the cold, and the warmth
had restored him to life. In Autumn all the swallows
fly away into warm countries, but if one
happens to linger, the cold seizes it, it becomes
frozen, and falls down as if dead. It remains
where it fell, and the cold snow covers it. Tiny
trembled very much. She was quite frightened,
for the bird was large, a great deal larger than
herself&mdash;she was only an inch high. But she
took courage, laid the wool more thickly over the
poor swallow, and then took a leaf which she had
used for her own counterpane, and laid it over
the head of the poor bird.</p>

<p>The next morning she again stole out to see
him. He was alive but very weak. He could
only open his eyes for a moment to look at Tiny,
who stood by holding a piece of decayed wood
in her hand, for she had no other lantern.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, pretty little maiden,&#8221; said the
sick swallow; &#8220;I have been so nicely warmed,
that I shall soon regain my strength, and be able
to fly about in the warm sunshine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said she, &#8220;it is cold out of doors now. It
snows and freezes. Stay in your warm bed. I
will take care of you.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>Then she brought the swallow some water in
a flower-leaf, and after he had drunk, he told her
that he had wounded one of his wings in a thorn-bush,
and could not fly so fast as the other birds,
who were soon far away on their journey to warm
countries. Then at last he had fallen to the
earth, and could remember no more nor how he
came to be where she had found him.</p>

<p>The whole Winter the swallow remained underground,
and Tiny nursed him with care and love.
Neither the mole nor the field-mouse knew anything
about it, for they did not like swallows.
Very soon the Spring-time came, and the sun
warmed the earth. Then the swallow bade farewell
to Tiny, and she opened the hole in the ceiling
which the mole had made. The sun shone in
upon them so beautifully that the swallow asked
her if she would go with him. She could sit on
his back, he said, and he would fly away with
her into the green woods. But Tiny knew it
would make the field-mouse very grieved if she
left her in that manner, so she said: &#8220;No, I
cannot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Farewell, then, farewell, you good, pretty,
little maiden!&#8221; said the swallow. And he flew
out into the sunshine.</p>

<p>Tiny looked after him, and the tears rose in
her eyes. She was very fond of the poor swallow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tweet! Tweet!&#8221; sang the bird, as he flew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
out into the green woods, and Tiny felt sad. She
was not allowed to go out into the warm sunshine.
The corn which had been sown in the field over
the house of the field-mouse had grown up high
into the air, and formed a thick wood to Tiny,
who was only an inch high.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are going to be married, Tiny,&#8221; said the
field-mouse. &#8220;My neighbour has asked for you.
What good fortune for a poor child like you!
Now we will prepare your wedding clothes.
They must be both woollen and linen. Nothing
must be wanting when you are the mole&#8217;s
wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tiny had to turn the spindle; and the field-mouse
hired four spiders, who were to weave
day and night. Every evening the mole visited
her, and was continually speaking of the time
when the Summer would be over. Then he would
keep his wedding-day with Tiny. But now the
heat of the sun was so great that it burned
the earth, and made it quite hard, like a stone.
As soon as the Summer was over, the wedding
should take place.</p>

<p>But Tiny was not at all pleased; for she did
not like the tiresome mole. Every morning when
the sun rose, and every evening when it went
down, she would creep out at the door, and as
the wind blew aside the ears of corn, so that she
could see the blue sky, she thought how beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
and bright it seemed out there, and wished so
much to see her dear swallow again. But he
never returned; for by this time he had flown far
away into the lovely green forest.</p>

<p>When Autumn arrived, Tiny had her outfit
quite ready; and the field-mouse said to her: &#8220;In
four weeks the wedding must take place.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Tiny wept, and said she would not marry
the disagreeable mole.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; replied the field-mouse. &#8220;Now,
don&#8217;t be obstinate, or I shall bite you with my
white teeth. He is a very handsome mole. The
Queen herself does not wear more beautiful velvets
and furs. His kitchen and cellars are quite
full. You ought to be very thankful for such
good fortune.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the wedding-day was fixed, on which the
mole was to fetch Tiny away to live with him,
deep under the earth, and never again to see
the warm sun, because <i>he</i> did not like it. The
poor child was most unhappy at the thought of
saying farewell to the beautiful sun; and, as the
field-mouse had given her permission to stand
at the door, she went to look at it once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Farewell, bright sun!&#8221; she cried, stretching
out her arm toward it. And then she walked a
short distance from the house; for the corn had
been cut, and only the dry stubble remained in
the fields. &#8220;Farewell! Farewell!&#8221; she repeated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
twining her arm round a little red flower that
grew just by her side. &#8220;Greet the little swallow
from me, if you should see him again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tweet! Tweet!&#8221; sounded over her head suddenly.
She looked up, and there was the swallow
himself flying close by. As soon as he spied Tiny,
he was delighted; and then she told him how unwilling
she felt to marry the ugly mole, and to
live always beneath the earth, and never to see
the bright sun any more. And as she told him
she wept.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cold Winter is coming,&#8221; said the swallow,
&#8220;and I am going to fly away into warmer countries.
Will you go with me? You can sit on my
back, and fasten yourself on with your sash.
Then we can fly away from the ugly mole and
his gloomy rooms&mdash;far away, over the mountains,
into warmer countries, where the sun shines
more brightly than here; where it is always Summer,
and the flowers bloom in greater beauty.
Fly now with me, dear little Tiny! You saved
my life when I lay frozen in that dark, dreary
passage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I will go with you,&#8221; said Tiny. And she
seated herself on the bird&#8217;s back, with her feet
on his outstretched wings, and tied her girdle
to one of his strongest feathers.</p>

<p>Then the swallow rose in the air, and flew over
forest and over sea, high above the highest mountains,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
covered with eternal snow. Tiny would
have been frozen in the cold air, but she crept
under the bird&#8217;s warm feathers, keeping her little
head uncovered, so that she might admire the
beautiful lands over which they passed.</p>

<p>At length they reached the warm countries,
where the sun shines brightly, and the sky seems
so much higher above the earth. Here, on the
hedges, and by the wayside, grew purple, green,
and white grapes; lemons and oranges hung from
trees in the woods; and the air was fragrant with
myrtles and orange blossoms. Beautiful children
ran along the country lanes, playing with large
gay butterflies. And, as the swallow flew farther
and farther, every place appeared still more
lovely.</p>

<p>At last they came to a blue lake, and by the
side of it, shaded by trees of the deepest green,
stood a palace of dazzling white marble, built
in the olden times. Vines clustered round its
lofty pillars, and at the top were many swallows&#8217;
nests, and one of these was the home of
the swallow who carried Tiny.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is my house,&#8221; said the swallow; &#8220;but it
would not do for you to live there&mdash;you would
not be comfortable. You must choose for yourself
one of those lovely flowers, and I will put
you down upon it, and then you shall have everything
that you can wish to make you happy.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>&#8220;That will be delightful!&#8221; she said, and clapped
her little hands for joy.</p>

<p>A large marble pillar lay on the ground, which,
in falling, had been broken into three pieces.
Between these pieces grew the most beautiful
large white flowers; so the swallow flew down
with Tiny, and placed her on one of the broad
leaves. But how surprised she was to see, in the
middle of the flowers, a tiny little man, as white
and transparent as if he had been made of crystal!
He had a gold crown on his head, and delicate
wings at his shoulders, and was not much larger
than Tiny herself. He was the Fairy of the flower;
for a tiny man and a tiny woman dwell in every
flower; and this was the King of them all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, how beautiful he is!&#8221; whispered Tiny
to the swallow.</p>

<p>The little King was at first quite frightened
at the bird, who was like a giant compared to
such a delicate little creature as himself. But
when he saw Tiny, he was delighted, and thought
her the prettiest little maiden he had ever seen.
He took the gold crown from his head, and placed
it on hers, and asked her name, and if she would
be his wife, and Queen over all the flowers.</p>

<p>This certainly was a very different sort of husband
to the son of the toad, or the mole, with his
black velvet and fur; so she said &#8220;Yes,&#8221; to the
handsome King.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>Then all the flowers opened, and out of each
came a little lady or a tiny lord, all so pretty it
was quite a pleasure to look at them. Each of
them brought Tiny a present. But the best gift
was a pair of beautiful wings, which had belonged
to a large white fly, and they fastened them
to Tiny&#8217;s shoulders, so that she might fly from
flower to flower.</p>

<p>Then there was much rejoicing, and the little
swallow, who sat above them, in his nest, was
asked to sing a wedding song, which he did as
well as he could; but in his heart he felt sad, for
he was very fond of Tiny, and would have liked
never to part from her again.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not be called Tiny any more,&#8221;
said the Fairy of the flowers to her. &#8220;It is an
ugly name, and you are so very pretty. We
will call you Maia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Farewell! Farewell!&#8221; said the swallow, with
a heavy heart as he left the warm countries, to
fly back into Denmark. There he had a nest
over the window of a house in which dwelt the
writer of Fairy tales. The swallow sang, &#8220;Tweet!
Tweet!&#8221; And from his song came this whole
story.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">THE IMMORTAL FOUNTAIN</h4></div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> ancient times two little Princesses lived in
Scotland, one of whom was extremely beautiful,
and the other dwarfish, dark-coloured, and deformed.
One was named Rose, and the other
Marion.</p>

<p>The sisters did not live happily together.
Marion hated Rose because the latter was handsome
and everybody praised her. So Marion
scowled and her face grew absolutely black when
anybody asked her how her pretty little sister
was. And once she was so wicked and jealous
that she cut off all Rose&#8217;s glossy golden hair, and
threw it in the fire. Poor Rose cried bitterly
about it, but she did not scold or strike her sister,
for she was an amiable and gentle little being.</p>

<p>No wonder, then, that all the family and all
the neighbours disliked Marion; and no wonder
that her face grew uglier and uglier every day.
But the neighbours used to say that Rose had
been blessed by the Fairies, to whom she owed
her extraordinary beauty and goodness.</p>

<p>Not far from the castle where the Princesses
resided was a deep grotto, said to lead to the
Palace of Beauty where the Queen of the Fairies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
held her Court. Some said that Rose had fallen
asleep there one day when she was tired of chasing
a butterfly, and that the Queen had dipped
her in an Immortal Fountain, from which she
had risen with the beauty of an angel. Marion
often asked Rose about this story, but the child
always replied that she was forbidden to speak
of it. When Rose saw any uncommon bird or
butterfly, she would exclaim: &#8220;Oh, how much
that looks like Fairyland!&#8221; But when asked
what she knew about Fairyland, she blushed and
would not answer.</p>

<p>Marion thought a great deal about this. &#8220;Why
can I not go to the Palace of Beauty?&#8221; thought
she. &#8220;And why may I not bathe in the Immortal
Fountain?&#8221;</p>

<p>One Summer&#8217;s noon, when all was still save
the faint twitterings of birds and the lazy hum of
bees, Marion entered the deep grotto. She sat
down on a bank of moss. The air around her
was as fragrant as if it came from a bed of violets.
And with the far-off sound of music in her ears,
she fell into a gentle slumber.</p>

<p>When she awoke it was evening, and she found
herself in a small hall, where opal pillars supported
a rainbow roof, the bright reflection of
which rested on crystal walls and on a golden
floor inlaid with pearls. All around, between the
opal pillars, stood the tiniest vases of pure alabaster,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
in which grew a multitude of brilliant
and fragrant flowers; some of which, twining
around the pillars, were lost in the floating rainbow
above. This scene of beauty was lighted by
millions of fireflies glittering in the air like wandering
stars.</p>

<p>While Marion was gazing in amazement at all
this, a little lady of rare loveliness stood before
her. Her robe was of green and gold. Her flowing
gossamer mantle was caught upon one shoulder
with a pearl, and in her hair was a solitary
star composed of five diamonds, each no bigger
than a pin point. She smiled at Marion and
sang:&mdash;</p>

<div class="verse"><i>Quick! Thy purposes declare!</i>&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>As she concluded, the song was taken up and
thrice repeated by a multitude of soft voices in
the distance. It seemed as if birds and insects
joined in the chorus; and ever and anon between
the pauses, the sound of a cascade was heard,
whose waters fell in music.</p>

<p>All these delightful sounds died away, and the
Queen of the Fairies stood patiently awaiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
Marion&#8217;s answer. Curtsying low, and with a
trembling voice, the little maiden said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will it please Your Majesty to make me as
handsome as my sister Rose?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Queen smiled again. &#8220;I will grant your
request,&#8221; said she, &#8220;if you will promise to fulfil
all the conditions I propose.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marion eagerly promised that she would.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Immortal Fountain,&#8221; continued the
Queen, &#8220;is on the top of a high, steep hill. At
four different places Fairies are stationed around
it, who guard it with their wands. None can
pass except those who obey my orders. Go home
now. For one week speak no ungentle word to
your sister. At the end of that time come again
to the grotto.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marion went home light of heart. Rose was
in the garden, watering flowers. And the first
thing Marion observed was that her sister&#8217;s
sunny hair had grown as long and beautiful as
before it was cut off. The sight made her angry,
and she was just about to snatch the watering-pot
from Rose&#8217;s hand with cross words, when
she remembered the Fairy, and passed into the
castle in silence.</p>

<p>The end of the week arrived, and Marion had
faithfully kept her promise. Again she entered
the grotto. The Queen was feasting when
Marion reached the hall with opal pillars. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
bees had brought, as a gift, golden honey, and
placed it on small rose-coloured shells which
adorned a crystal table. Bright butterflies
floated about the head of the Queen, and fanned
her with their wings. Fireflies flew near to give
her light. And a large diamond beetle formed
her footstool. After she had supped, a dew-drop
on a violet petal was brought her to bathe her
royal fingers.</p>

<p>Behind the Queen&#8217;s chair hovered numerous
bright Fairies, but when Marion entered the
diamond sparkles on their wings faded as they
always do in the presence of anything bad. And
in a second all the Queen&#8217;s attendants vanished,
singing as they went:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>&#8220;Mortal, have you fulfilled your promise?&#8221;
asked the Queen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have,&#8221; replied the maiden.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then follow me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marion did as she was directed, and away
they hastened over beds of Violets and Mignonette.
Birds sang, butterflies fluttered, and the
voices of many fountains came on the breeze.</p>

<p>Presently they reached the hill on the top of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
which was the Immortal Fountain. The foot of
the hill was surrounded by a band of Fairies
clothed in green gossamer, and with their ivory
wands crossed to bar the ascent. The Queen
waved her wand over them, and immediately
they stretched their transparent wings and flew
away.</p>

<p>The hill was steep, and far, far up climbed the
Queen and Marion. The air became more and
more fragrant; and more and more distinctly
they heard the sound of waters falling in music.
At length they were stopped by another band
of Fairies, clothed in blue gossamer, with silver
wands crossed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; said the Queen, &#8220;our journey must
end. You can go no farther until you have fulfilled
the orders I shall give you. Go home now.
For one month do by your sister as you would
wish her to do by you, if you were Rose and she
Marion.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marion promised and departed. She found the
task harder than the first had been. When Rose
asked her for playthings, she found it hard to
give them gently and affectionately. When Rose
talked to her, she wanted to go away in silence.
And when a pocket mirror was found in her sister&#8217;s
room, broken into a thousand pieces, she
felt sorely tempted to conceal that she had done
the mischief. But she was so anxious to be made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
beautiful that she did as she wished to be done
by·</p>

<p>All the household remarked how Marion had
changed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I love her dearly!&#8221; said Rose; &#8220;she is so
good and amiable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I!&#8221; said a dozen voices.</p>

<p>Marion blushed deeply, and her eyes sparkled
with pleasure. &#8220;How pleasant it is to be loved!&#8221;
thought she.</p>

<p>At the end of the month she went to the grotto
again. Again the Fairy Queen conducted her up
the hill, and this time the Fairies in blue lowered
their silver wands and flew away. The two travelled
on, higher and higher. The path grew
steeper and steeper, but the fragrant air became
more delicious, and more distinctly was heard
the sound of waters falling in music.</p>

<p>At length their course was stayed by a troop
of Fairies clothed in rainbow robes, and holding
silver wands tipped with gold. In face and
form they were far more beautiful than anything
Marion had yet seen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here we must pause,&#8221; said the Queen. &#8220;This
boundary you cannot yet pass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; asked the impatient Marion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because those who pass the Rainbow Fairies
must be very pure,&#8221; replied the Queen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I not very pure?&#8221; asked the maiden. &#8220;All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
the people in the castle tell me how good I have
grown.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mortal eyes see only the outside,&#8221; answered
the Queen. &#8220;But those who pass the Rainbow
Fairies must be pure in thought as well as action.
Go home now. For three months never indulge
in a wicked or envious thought. You shall then
have a glimpse of the Immortal Fountain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marion returned home. At the end of three
months she again visited the hall with opal pillars.
The Queen did not smile when she saw her;
but in silence led the way up the hill toward the
Immortal Fountain. The Green Fairies and the
Blue Fairies flew away as they approached; but
the Rainbow Fairies bowed low to the Queen,
and kept their gold-tipped wands firmly crossed.</p>

<p>Marion saw that the silver specks on the
Fairies&#8217; wings began to grow dim, and she burst
into tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew,&#8221; said the Queen, &#8220;that you could
not pass this boundary. Envy has been in your
heart. But be not discouraged, for years you
have been indulging in wrong feelings; and you
must not wonder if it takes many months to drive
them out. Go home and try once more.&#8221;</p>

<p>So poor Marion went sadly away. And when
she visited the hall again, the Queen smiled,
and touched her playfully with her wand. She
then led her up the hill to the Immortal Fountain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
The silver specks on the wings of the Rainbow
Fairies shone bright as Marion approached,
and the Fairies lowered their wings and flew
away.</p>

<p>And now every footstep was on flowers that
yielded beneath the feet like a pathway of clouds.
The delicious fragrance could almost be felt,
and loud and clear and sweet came the sound of
waters falling in music. And now Marion could
see a cascade leaping and sparkling over crystal
rocks. Above it rested a rainbow. The spray
fell in pearls forming delicate foliage around the
margin of the Fountain. And deep and silent
below the foam of the cascade was the Immortal
Fountain of Beauty. Its amber-coloured waves
flowed over a golden bed, and many Fairies were
bathing in its waves, the diamonds in their hair
gleaming like sunbeams on the water.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, let me bathe in the Fountain!&#8221; cried
Marion, clapping her hands in delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; said the Queen. &#8220;Behold the Purple
Fairies with golden wands that guard its
brink.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marion looked, and saw Beings lovelier than
any her eye had ever rested on.</p>

<p>&#8220;You cannot pass them yet,&#8221; said the Queen.
&#8220;Go home. For one year drive from your heart
all evil feelings, not for the sake of bathing in
this Fountain, but because goodness is lovely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
and desirable for its own sake. Then your work
is done.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marion returned home. This was the hardest
task of all. For she had been willing to be good,
not because it was right, but because she wished
to be beautiful. Three times she sought the
grotto, and three times she left in tears, for the
golden specks on the wings of the Purple Fairies
grew dim as she approached, and the golden
wands were still crossed to shut her from the
Immortal Fountain.</p>

<p>But the fourth time the Purple Fairies lowered
their wands, singing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;<i>Thou hast scaled the mountain,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Go, bathe in the Fountain;</i></div>
<div class="indent"><i>Rise fair to the sight,</i></div>
<div class="indent"><i>As an angel of light;</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Go bathe in the Fountain!</i>&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Marion, full of joy, was about to plunge in, but
the Queen touched her, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look in the mirror of the water. Art thou
not already as beautiful as heart can wish?&#8221;</p>

<p>Marion looked at herself, and saw that her
eyes sparkled with new lustre, a bright colour
shone in her cheeks, her hair waved softly about
her face, and dimples played sweetly around her
mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I have not touched the Immortal Fountain!&#8221;
cried she, turning in surprise to the
Queen.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>&#8220;True,&#8221; replied the Queen. &#8220;But its waters
have been within your soul. Know that a pure
and happy heart, and gentleness toward others,
are the only Immortal Fountains of Beauty!&#8221;</p>

<p>Marion thanked the Queen, and joyfully returned
home.</p>

<p>Rose ran to meet her, and clasped her to her
bosom fervently.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know all,&#8221; she said; &#8220;I have been in Fairyland.
Disguised as a bird, I have watched all
your steps. When you first went to the grotto,
I begged the Queen to grant your wish.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ever after the sisters lived lovingly together.
It was the remark of every one: &#8220;How handsome
Marion has grown! The ugly scowl has departed
from her face, her eyes are so clear and
gentle, her mouth is so pretty and smiling. To
my taste she is as handsome as Rose.&#8221;</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">THE STORY OF CHILDE CHARITY</h4></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time there lived in the west country
a little girl who had neither father nor mother;
they both died when she was very young, and
left their daughter to the care of her uncle, who
was the richest farmer in all that country. He
had houses and lands, flocks and herds, many
servants to work about his house and fields, a
wife who had brought him a great dowry, and
two fair daughters.</p>

<p>All their neighbours, being poor, looked up to
the family&mdash;insomuch that they imagined themselves
great people. The father and mother were
as proud as peacocks; the daughters thought
themselves the greatest beauties in the world,
and not one of the family would speak civilly to
anybody they thought low.</p>

<p>Now it happened that though she was their
near relation, they had this opinion of the orphan
girl, partly because she had no fortune, and partly
because of her humble, kindly disposition. It
was said that the more needy and despised any
creature was, the more ready was she to befriend
it: on which account the people of the west country
called her Childe Charity, and if she had any
other name, I never heard it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>Childe Charity was thought very mean in that
proud house. Her uncle would not own her for
his niece; her cousins would not keep her company;
and her aunt sent her to work in the dairy,
and to sleep in the back garret, where they kept
all sorts of lumber and dry herbs for the winter.
The servants learned the same tune, and Childe
Charity had more work than rest among them.
All the day she scoured pails, scrubbed dishes,
and washed crockeryware. But every night she
slept in the back garret as sound as a Princess
could in her palace chamber.</p>

<p>Her uncle&#8217;s house was large and white, and
stood among green meadows by a river&#8217;s side.
In front it had a porch covered with a vine; behind,
it had a farmyard and high granaries.
Within, there were two parlours for the rich, and
two kitchens for the poor, which the neighbours
thought wonderfully grand. And one day in the
harvest season, when this rich farmer&#8217;s corn had
been all cut down and housed, he condescended
so far as to invite his neighborhood to a harvest
supper. The west country people came in their
holiday clothes and best behaviour. Such heaps
of cakes and cheese, such baskets of apples and
barrels of ale, had never been at feast before.</p>

<p>They were making merry in kitchen and parlour,
when a poor old woman came to the back
door, begging for broken victuals and a night&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
lodging. Her clothes were coarse and ragged; her
hair was scanty and grey; her back was bent;
her teeth were gone. She had a squinting eye,
a clubbed foot, and crooked fingers. In short,
she was the poorest and ugliest old woman that
ever came begging.</p>

<p>The first who saw her was the kitchen-maid,
and she ordered her to be gone for an ugly witch.
The next was the herd-boy, and he threw her
a bone over his shoulder. But Childe Charity,
hearing the noise, came out from her seat at the
foot of the lowest table, and asked the old woman
to take her share of the supper, and sleep that
night in her bed in the back garret.</p>

<p>The old woman sat down without a word of
thanks. All the company laughed at Childe
Charity for giving her bed and her supper to a
beggar. Her proud cousins said it was just like
her mean spirit, but Childe Charity did not mind
them. She scraped the pots for her supper that
night and slept on a sack among the lumber,
while the old woman rested in her warm bed.</p>

<p>And next morning, before the little girl awoke,
the old woman was up and gone, without so
much as saying &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; or &#8220;Good morning.&#8221;</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_350f.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;CHILDE CHARITY CAME OUT AND ASKED THE OLD WOMAN
TO TAKE HER SHARE OF THE SUPPER&#8221;</p>

<p>That day all the servants were sick after the
feast, and mostly cross too&mdash;so you may judge
how civil they were; when, at supper time, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
should come to the back door but the old woman,
again asking for broken victuals and a night&#8217;s
lodging.</p>



<p>No one would listen to her or give her a morsel,
till Childe Charity rose from her seat at the
foot of the lowest table, and kindly asked her to
take her supper, and sleep in her bed in the back
garret. Again the old woman sat down without
a word. Childe Charity scraped the pots for her
supper, and slept on the sack.</p>

<p>In the morning the old woman was gone; but
for six nights after, as sure as the supper was
spread, there was she at the back door, and the
little girl regularly asked her in.</p>

<p>Childe Charity&#8217;s aunt said she would let her
get enough of beggars. Her cousins made continual
game of what they called her genteel visitor.
Sometimes the old woman said: &#8220;Child,
why don&#8217;t you make this bed softer? and why
are your blankets so thin?&#8221; but she never gave
her a word of thanks, nor a civil good morning.</p>

<p>At last, on the ninth night from her first coming,
when Childe Charity was getting used to
scrape the pots and sleep on the sack, her accustomed
knock came at the door, and there she
stood with an ugly ashy-coloured dog, so stupid-looking
and clumsy that no herd-boy would keep
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good evening, my little girl,&#8221; she said when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
Childe Charity opened the door. &#8220;I will not
have your supper and bed to-night&mdash;I am going
on a long journey to see a friend. But here
is a dog of mine, whom nobody in all the west
country will keep for me. He is a little cross,
and not very handsome; but I leave him to your
care till the shortest day in all the year. Then
you and I will count for his keeping.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the old woman had said the last word,
she set off with such speed that Childe Charity
lost sight of her in a minute. The ugly dog began
to fawn upon her, but he snarled at everybody
else. The servants said he was a disgrace
to the house. The proud cousins wanted him
drowned, and it was with great trouble that
Childe Charity got leave to keep him in an old
ruined cow-house.</p>

<p>Ugly and cross as the dog was, he fawned on
her, and the old woman had left him to her care.
So the little girl gave him part of all her meals,
and when the hard frost came, took him privately
to her own back garret, because the cow-house
was damp and cold in the long nights.
The dog lay quietly on some straw in a corner.
Childe Charity slept soundly, but every morning
the servants would say to her:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;What great light and fine talking was that
in your back garret?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was no light, but the moon shining in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
through the shutterless window, and no talk
that I heard,&#8221; said Childe Charity.</p>

<p>And she thought they must have been dreaming.
But night after night, when any of them
awoke in the dark and silent hour that comes
before the morning, they saw a light brighter
and clearer than the Christmas fire, and heard
voices like those of lords and ladies in the back
garret.</p>

<p>Partly from fear, and partly from laziness,
none of the servants would rise to see what might
be there. At length, when the winter nights
were at the longest, the little parlour-maid, who
did least work and got most favour, because she
gathered news for her mistress, crept out of bed
when all the rest were sleeping, and set herself
to watch at a crevice of the door.</p>

<p>She saw the dog lying quietly in the corner,
Childe Charity sleeping soundly in her bed, and
the moon shining through the shutterless window.
But an hour before daybreak there came
a glare of lights, and a sound of far-off bugles.
The window opened, and in marched a troop of
little men clothed in crimson and gold, and bearing
every man a torch, till the room looked bright
as day. They marched up with great reverence
to the dog, where he lay on the straw, and the
most richly clothed among them said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Royal Prince, we have prepared the banquet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
hall. What will Your Highness please that we
do next?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye have done well,&#8221; said the dog. &#8220;Now,
prepare the feast, and see that all things be in
our first fashion: for the Princess and I mean to
bring a stranger who never feasted in our halls
before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Highness&#8217;s commands shall be obeyed,&#8221;
said the little man, making another reverence; and
he and his company passed out of the window.</p>

<p>By and by there was another glare of lights,
and a sound like far-off flutes. The window
opened, and there came in a company of little
ladies clad in rose-coloured velvet, and carrying
each a crystal lamp. They also walked with
great reverence up to the dog, and the gayest
among them said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Royal Prince, we have prepared the tapestry.
What will Your Highness please that we do
next?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye have done well,&#8221; said the dog. &#8220;Now,
prepare the robes, and let all things be in our
first fashion: for the Princess and I will bring
with us a stranger who never feasted in our halls
before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Highness&#8217;s commands shall be obeyed,&#8221;
said the little lady, making a low curtsy; and
she and her company passed out through the
window, which closed quietly behind them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>The dog stretched himself out upon the straw,
the little girl turned in her sleep, and the moon
shone in on the back garret.</p>

<p>The parlour-maid was so much amazed, and
so eager to tell this great story to her mistress,
that she could not close her eyes that night, and
was up before cock-crow. But when she told it,
her mistress called her a silly wench to have such
foolish dreams, and scolded her so that the parlour-maid
durst not mention what she had seen
to the servants.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Childe Charity&#8217;s aunt thought
there might be something in it worth knowing;
so next night, when all the house were asleep,
she crept out of bed, and set herself to watch at
the back garret door.</p>

<p>There she saw exactly what the maid told her&mdash;the
little men with the torches, and the little
ladies with the crystal lamps, come in making
great reverence to the dog, and the same words
pass, only he said to the one, &#8220;Now prepare
the presents,&#8221; and to the other, &#8220;Prepare the
jewels.&#8221;</p>

<p>And when they were gone the dog stretched
himself on the straw, Childe Charity turned in
her sleep, and the moon shone in on the back
garret.</p>

<p>The mistress could not close her eyes any
more than the maid from eagerness to tell the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
story. She woke up Childe Charity&#8217;s rich uncle
before cock-crow. But when he heard it, he
laughed at her for a foolish woman, and advised
her not to repeat the like before the neighbours,
lest they should think she had lost her senses.</p>

<p>The mistress could say no more, and the day
passed. But that night the master thought he
would like to see what went on in the back garret:
so when all the house were asleep, he slipped
out of bed, and set himself to watch at the crevice
in the door.</p>

<p>The same thing happened again that the maid
and the mistress saw: the little men in crimson
with their torches, and the little ladies in rose-coloured
velvet with their lamps, came in at the
window, and made an humble reverence to the
ugly dog, the one saying, &#8220;Royal Prince, we have
prepared the presents,&#8221; and the other, &#8220;Royal
Prince, we have prepared the jewels.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the dog said to them all: &#8220;Ye have done
well. To-morrow come and meet me and the
Princess with horses and chariots, and let all
things be in our first fashion: for we will bring a
stranger from this house who has never travelled
with us, nor feasted in our halls before.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little men and the little ladies said: &#8220;Your
Highness&#8217;s commands shall be obeyed.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they had gone out through the window
the ugly dog stretched himself out on the straw,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
Childe Charity turned in her sleep, and the moon
shone in on the back garret.</p>

<p>The master could not close his eyes any
more than the maid or the mistress, for thinking
of this strange sight. He remembered to have
heard his grandfather say, that somewhere near
his meadows there lay a path leading to the
Fairies&#8217; country, and the haymakers used to see
it shining through the grey Summer morning as
the Fairy bands went home. Nobody had heard
or seen the like for many years; but the master
concluded that the doings in his back garret
must be a Fairy business, and the ugly dog a
person of great account. His chief wonder was,
however, what visitor the Fairies intended to take
from his house; and after thinking the matter
over he was sure it must be one of his daughters&mdash;they
were so handsome, and had such fine
clothes.</p>

<p>Accordingly, Childe Charity&#8217;s rich uncle made
it his first business that morning to get ready a
breakfast of roast mutton for the ugly dog, and
carry it to him in the old cow-house. But not a
morsel would the dog taste. On the contrary, he
snarled at the master, and would have bitten
him if he had not run away with his mutton.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Fairies have strange ways,&#8221; said the
master to himself. But he called his daughters
privately, bidding them dress themselves in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
best, for he could not say which of them might
be called into great company before nightfall.</p>

<p>Childe Charity&#8217;s proud cousins, hearing this,
put on the richest of their silks and laces, and
strutted like peacocks from kitchen to parlour
all day, waiting for the call their father spoke of,
while the little girl scoured and scrubbed in the
dairy.</p>

<p>They were in very bad humour when night
fell, and nobody had come. But just as the family
were sitting down to supper the ugly dog
began to bark, and the old woman&#8217;s knock was
heard at the back door. Childe Charity opened
it, and was going to offer her bed and supper as
usual, when the old woman said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the shortest day in all the year, and
I am going home to hold a feast after my travels.
I see you have taken good care of my dog, and
now if you will come with me to my house, he
and I will do our best to entertain you. Here is
our company.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the old woman spoke there was a sound
of far-off flutes and bugles, then a glare of lights;
and a great company, clad so grandly that they
shone with gold and jewels, came in open chariots,
covered with gilding, and drawn by snow-white
horses.</p>

<p>The first and finest of the chariots was empty.
The old woman led Childe Charity to it by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
hand, and the ugly dog jumped in before her.
The proud cousins, in all their finery, had by this
time come to the door, but nobody wanted them.
And no sooner was the old woman and her dog
within the chariot than a marvellous change
passed over them, for the ugly old woman turned
at once to a beautiful young Princess, with long
yellow curls and a robe of green and gold, while
the ugly dog at her side started up a fair young
Prince, with nut-brown hair, and a robe of purple
and silver.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are,&#8221; said they, as the chariots drove
on, and the little girl sat astonished, &#8220;a Prince
and Princess of Fairyland, and there was a wager
between us whether or not there were good people
still to be found in these false and greedy
times. One said &#8216;Yes,&#8217; and the other said &#8216;No&#8217;;
and I have lost,&#8221; said the Prince, &#8220;and must
pay the feast and presents.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some of the farmer&#8217;s household, who were
looking after them through the moonlight night,
said the chariots had gone one way across the
meadows, some said they had gone another, and
till this day they cannot agree upon the direction.</p>

<p>But Childe Charity went with that noble company
into a country such as she had never seen&mdash;for
Primroses covered all the ground, and the
light was always like that of a Summer evening.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
They took her to a royal palace, where there was
nothing but feasting and dancing for seven days.
She had robes of pale green velvet to wear, and
slept in a chamber inlaid with ivory.</p>

<p>When the feast was done, the Prince and Princess
gave her such heaps of gold and jewels that
she could not carry them, but they gave her a
chariot to go home in, drawn by six white horses.
And on the seventh night, which happened to be
Christmas time, when the farmer&#8217;s family had
settled in their own minds that she would never
come back, and were sitting down to supper,
they heard the sound of her coachman&#8217;s bugle,
and saw her alight with all the jewels and gold
at the very back door where she had brought in
the ugly old woman.</p>

<p>The Fairy chariot drove away, and never came
back to that farmhouse after. But Childe Charity
scrubbed and scoured no more, for she grew a
great lady, even in the eyes of her proud cousins.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
<h4 class="nobreak">THE SHINING CHILD AND THE
WICKED MOUCHE</h4></div>


<h5>HOW THE RICH COUSINS CAME</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time a noble but poor Count lived
in the lovely land of Alsace. He dwelt in a
charming little house on a hill. All around the
house the graceful trees stretched out their leafy
branches like arms, as if they were saying: &#8220;Welcome!
Welcome among us!&#8221; Not far from the
house was a thick green wood filled with birds
and flowers and scented grasses. The good Count
did not live alone in this delightful spot; no indeed,
his wife and his two children, Fanchon
and Frederic, lived with him, happy and contented.</p>

<p>Now, one Summer the news arrived that a
wealthy and distinguished nobleman, cousin of
the Count, was coming the next day, with his
family, to call upon his poor relatives.</p>

<p>The following morning the Countess got up
very early, and baked a cake into which she put
more almonds and raisins than she ever put into
her Easter cakes, so that its delicious fragrance
filled the house. The Count dusted and brushed
his old green waistcoat; while Fanchon and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
Frederic, dressed in their best clothes, sat waiting
for the guests to come.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not run about in the wood, as you
usually do,&#8221; said the Count to them, &#8220;but sit
very still so that you will look clean and neat
when your cousins arrive.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the poor children were forced to stay in the
house. The morning sun was peeping bright and
smiling from behind a cloud, and was darting
his rays in at the window. Out in the wood
the breeze was blowing sweet and fresh, and
the robins, the thrushes, the goldfinches, and the
nightingales, were all warbling their loveliest
songs. Poor Fanchon sat still and listened, sometimes
smoothing the bow on her pink sash, and
sometimes knitting a bit, and all the while longing
to run away to the wood. As for Frederic,
he was looking at a picture book, but he kept
jumping up every minute to gaze out at the window;
for the big house dog Pepin was barking
and bounding before the window, as if to say:
&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you coming out? What in the world
are you doing in that stuffy room?&#8221;</p>

<p>And so Fanchon and Frederic had to remain
in the house; and this was all the more painful,
because the company-cake, which was on the
table, gave out the most delicious spicy odours,
yet might not be cut until the cousins came.
&#8220;Oh! that they would only come!&mdash;would only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
come!&#8221; the children cried, and almost wept with
impatience.</p>

<p>At last the loud tramping of horses was heard,
and the rumble of wheels, then a carriage approached,
so brilliant and so covered with golden
ornaments that the children were amazed, for
they had never seen anything like it. The carriage
stopped before the house, and a very tall,
thin gentleman glided out with the help of a
footman, and fell into the arms of the Count, to
whose cheek he gently pressed his lips. Then
the footman aided a stout, red-faced woman to
alight, while two children, a boy and a girl,
stepped languidly down after her.</p>

<p>When they were all safely in the house, Fanchon
and Frederic came forward and curtsied
politely, as their father had told them to do.
Then each seized a hand of the tall gentleman,
saying: &#8220;We are glad you are come, noble
Cousin!&#8221; After which they permitted the red-faced
lady to embrace them; then they went
up to the children, but stood before them silent
and amazed. Indeed, these rich children were
wonderfully dressed! The boy wore a little
jacket of scarlet cloth, embroidered with gold
and ornamented with gold tassels. A bright
little sword hung at his side. On his head was a
curious red cap with a white feather, from under
which peeped his yellow face and bleared eyes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>The little girl had on a white dress all ribbons,
lace, and bows, and her hair was frizzled and
curled into a knot, on top of which was a shining
coronet. Fanchon plucked up courage, and was
going to take the little girl&#8217;s hand, but she
snatched it away in such a hurry and looked so
tearful and angry, that Fanchon was frightened
and let her alone.</p>

<p>Frederic wished to have a closer look at the
boy&#8217;s sword, and put out his hand to touch it,
when the youngster began to shout and cry:
&#8220;My sword! My sword! He is going to take
my sword!&#8221; and ran to his father and hid behind
him.</p>

<p>After that Fanchon and Frederic stood back
quietly, while their mother cut the cake, and the
older people talked. The two rich children sat
munching dry crackers, for their parents said
that cake was not good for them. But Fanchon
and Frederic each had a large slice, which their
dear mother gave them.</p>

<p>After they had finished eating, the guests
arose to say good-bye, and the glittering carriage
was driven to the door. The footman took from
it two large bandboxes. These, the rich children
handed with condescending pride, to Fanchon
and Frederic. And just as the guests were about
to take their leave, the dog Pepin, Frederic&#8217;s
faithful friend and darling, came dancing and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
barking around them. The rich children screamed,
and had to be lifted, kicking with fright, into the
carriage, which immediately drove away.</p>

<p>So ended the visit of these wealthy, distinguished,
and noble cousins.</p>


<h5>THE NEW PLAYTHINGS</h5>

<p>After the carriage containing the wealthy
cousins had rolled down the hill, the Count threw
off his green waistcoat, and put on his loose
jacket, and ran his fingers through his hair. The
children, too, quickly got out of their best clothes,
and felt light and happy.</p>

<p>&#8220;To the wood! To the wood!&#8221; shouted Frederic,
jumping as high as he could for joy.</p>

<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t you wish to see what is in these
handsome bandboxes your cousins gave you?&#8221;
asked his mother.</p>

<p>And Fanchon, who had been gazing at the bandboxes
with longing eyes, cried out: &#8220;Can&#8217;t we
open them first, and go to the wood afterward?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Frederic was hard to convince. &#8220;Surely
that stupid boy could not have brought anything
worth while,&#8221; said he scornfully, &#8220;nor his
ribbony sister! He talked so boldly about bears
and lions, but when my dear Pepin barked, he
forgot his sword and hid under the table! A
brave sportsman he!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, dear, good brother!&#8221; cried Fanchon, &#8220;just
let us take one peep at what is in the boxes!&#8221;</p>

<p>So Frederic, who always did what he could to
please his sister, gave up the idea of being off to
the wood at once, and sat down patiently beside
the table where the bandboxes were.</p>

<p>The mother opened them&mdash;and then&mdash;oh,
my dear readers, if you could have seen what
lay within! The loveliest toys were in those
boxes! and candies, and sweet cakes, and nuts!
The children clapped their hands again and
again, crying: &#8220;Oh, how nice! Oh, how delicious!&#8221;</p>

<p>They took them all out of the boxes, and piled
them on the table. None of the toys caused
Frederic such satisfaction as did a little hunter
who, when a string that stuck out from his
jacket was pulled, put a gun to his shoulder,
and fired at a target. Next to him in Frederic&#8217;s
affections, was a little fellow who bowed, and
twanged on a harp, whenever Frederic turned
a tiny handle. And, what pleased him nearly as
much, was a shotgun of wood and a hunting
pouch and belt.</p>

<p>Fanchon was equally delighted with a beautiful
doll, a trunk filled with doll&#8217;s dresses, tiny
shoes, hats, and other lovely clothes, and a set
of charming doll&#8217;s furniture.</p>

<p>The two children forgot all about the wood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
and enjoyed themselves with their playthings
until quite late in the evening. They then went
to bed and slept soundly.</p>


<h5>WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PLAYTHINGS IN
THE WOOD</h5>

<p>The next morning, the children got their boxes
and took out the playthings, and began to play.
Then, just as on the day before, the sun shone
brightly in at the window, the trees rustled in
the breeze, and the birds sang their loveliest
songs. At last Frederic cried out:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do we sit here in this stuffy room? I&#8217;ll
tell you what we&#8217;ll do! Come, Fanchon, let us
be off to the wood!&#8221;</p>

<p>Fanchon had just undressed her doll, and was
going to put it to bed. &#8220;Why can&#8217;t we stay here?&#8221;
she begged, &#8220;and play a little longer, Frederic?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what we&#8217;ll do,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll take our toys out to the wood. I&#8217;ll put
on my pouch and belt, and carry my gun. I&#8217;ll be
a real sportsman! The hunter and the harper may
come, too. And you may take your doll. Come
along! Let&#8217;s be off!&#8221;</p>

<p>Fanchon hastened to dress her doll, then they
both ran out of the house, and off to the wood.
There they sat down on a nice grassy spot. And
after they had played a while, Fanchon said:&mdash;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>&#8220;Do you know, Frederic, that harper of yours
does not play very well. Just listen how funny
his harp sounds out here in the wood&mdash;with
that eternal <i>ting! ting! ping! ping!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Frederic turned the handle more violently.
&#8220;You&#8217;re right, Fanchon,&#8221; said he. &#8220;What the
little fellow plays sounds quite horrible. He
must make a better job of it!&#8221;</p>

<p>And with that he unscrewed the handle with
such force, that&mdash;<i>crack! crack!</i>&mdash;the box on
which the harper stood flew into a thousand
splinters, and the arms of the little fellow were
broken and hung useless at his sides.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Oh!&#8221; cried Frederic.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, the poor little harper!&#8221; sighed Fanchon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he was a stupid creature!&#8221; said Frederic.
&#8220;He played very poor music, and bowed,
and made faces like our yellow-faced cousin who
gave him to us.&#8221; And as Frederic spoke, he
threw the harper into a thicket.</p>

<p>&#8220;What I like, is my hunter,&#8221; he continued.
&#8220;He hits the bull&#8217;s eye every time he fires.&#8221; And
with that Frederic jerked the string so violently
that&mdash;<i>twang! twang!</i>&mdash;the target was broken
and the little man&#8217;s arms hung limp and motionless.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! Ah!&#8221; cried Frederic. &#8220;You could shoot
at your target in-doors, but out here, you can&#8217;t
shoot at all!&#8221; And so saying, Frederic, with all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
his might, shied the hunter after the harper into
the thicket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, let us run about a bit,&#8221; said he to
Fanchon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes! let us,&#8221; said she. &#8220;This lovely doll
of mine shall run with us. It will be great fun!&#8221;</p>

<p>So Fanchon and Frederic took each an arm
of the doll, and off they ran through the bushes,
on and on, until they came to a small lake. There
they stopped, and Frederic said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose we wait a minute. I have a gun
now, and perhaps I may hit a duck among the
rushes.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment, Fanchon screamed out: &#8220;Oh!
just look at my doll! What&#8217;s the matter with
her?&#8221;</p>

<p>Indeed, the poor thing was in a miserable condition.
Neither Fanchon nor Frederic had been
paying any attention to her, and the bushes had
torn all the clothes off her back; both her legs
were broken; while her pretty waxen face was
covered with so many scratches that it was
hideous to look at.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! my beautiful, beautiful child!&#8221; sobbed
Fanchon.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, you see what a stupid creature that
doll of yours is!&#8221; cried Frederic. &#8220;She can&#8217;t even
take a little run, but she must tear and spoil her
clothes! Give her to me!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>And before Fanchon could say a word, or cry:
&#8220;Oh! Oh!&#8221; Frederic snatched the doll, and flung
her into the lake.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, Fanchon!&#8221; said he consolingly.
&#8220;Never mind, if I can shoot a duck, you shall
have the most beautiful wing-feathers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then a noise was heard among the rushes,
and Frederic instantly took aim with his wooden
gun. But he dropped it quickly from his shoulder,
saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I not an idiot! How can a fellow shoot a
duck without powder and shot? What&#8217;s the use
of this stupid wooden thing, anyway?&#8221; With
that he flung the gun and his pouch and belt
into the lake.</p>

<p>But poor Fanchon was weeping at the loss of
her doll, and Frederic was annoyed at the way
things had turned out, so they both crept back
sadly to the house. And when their mother
asked them what had become of the playthings,
Frederic truthfully related how they had been
deceived by the harper, the hunter, the doll, and
all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! you foolish children!&#8221; cried their mother
half in anger, &#8220;you do not deserve to have nice
toys!&#8221;</p>

<p>But the Count, who had been listening to
Frederic&#8217;s tale, said: &#8220;Let the children alone. I
am really glad that they are fairly rid of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
playthings. There was something queer about
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>But neither the children nor their mother
understood what the Count meant.</p>


<h5>THE STRANGER CHILD</h5>

<p>Soon after these events very early one morning
Fanchon and Frederic ran off to the wood.
They were feeling sad, for their mother had told
them that they must return home soon to study,
so as to be ready for the tutor that their rich
cousin had promised to send them. For the tutor
was expected shortly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us run and jump as much as we can now,&#8221;
said Frederic, when they reached the wood, &#8220;for
in a little while we shall not be allowed to stay
out here at all!&#8221;</p>

<p>So they began to play hide-and-seek, but everything
went wrong. The wind carried Frederic&#8217;s
hat into the bushes. He stumbled and fell on his
nose as he was running. Fanchon found herself
hanging by her clothes on a thorn-tree, and she
banged her foot against a sharp stone so that she
shrieked with pain. In fact the children could
not understand what was the matter with them
on this particular day; and they gave up their
game, and slunk dejectedly through the wood.
Frederic threw himself down under a shady tree,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
and Fanchon followed his example. And there
the two children lay gloomy and wretched, gazing
on the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Fanchon, &#8220;if we only had our playthings!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; said Frederic, &#8220;what should we
do with them? I&#8217;ll tell you what it is, Fanchon,
Mother is right, I suspect. The toys were good
enough, but we didn&#8217;t know how to play with
them. If we were as learned as our rich cousins,
we should be so wise that all our toys would
now be whole; and we should know how to play
with them rightly.&#8221;</p>

<p>And at that Fanchon began to sob and cry
bitterly, and Frederic joined her; and they both
howled and lamented until the wood rang again
and again: &#8220;Oh! poor, unfortunate children that
we are! Oh! that we were as wise as our cousins!&#8221;</p>

<p>But suddenly they both stopped crying, and
asked each other in amazement:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you hear anything, Fanchon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you hear anything, Frederic?&#8221;</p>

<p>For out of the deepest shade of the dark thicket
in front of the children, a wonderful brightness
began to shine, playing like moonlight over the
leaves that trembled as if in joy. Then through
the whispering trees came a sweet musical note,
like the sound of a harp. The children lay motionless
with awe. All their sorrow passed away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
from them, and tender, happy tears rose into
their eyes.</p>

<p>As the radiance streamed brighter and brighter
through the bushes, and the marvellous music
grew louder and louder, the children&#8217;s hearts
beat high. They gazed eagerly at the brightness.
Then they saw, smiling at them from the thicket,
the most beautiful face of a child, with the sun
beaming on it in splendour.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! come to us!&mdash;Come to us!&mdash;darling
Shining Child!&#8221; cried Fanchon and Frederic,
stretching out their arms; and their hearts were
filled with an indescribable longing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am coming! I am coming!&#8221; a sweet voice
cried from the bushes.</p>

<p>And then, as if borne on the wings of the breeze,
the Stranger Child seemed to float hovering
toward Fanchon and Frederic.</p>


<h5>HOW THE SHINING CHILD PLAYED WITH
FANCHON AND FREDERIC</h5>

<p>&#8220;What is the matter, dear children?&#8221; asked
the Stranger Child. &#8220;I heard you crying and
lamenting, and I was very sorry for you! What
do you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Frederic, &#8220;we did not know what
we wanted; but now I see that we wanted <i>you</i>&mdash;just
you yourself!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>&#8220;That&#8217;s it!&#8221; chimed in Fanchon. &#8220;Now that
you are with us, we are happy again! Why were
you so long in coming?&#8221;</p>

<p>In fact both children felt as if they had known
and played with the Stranger Child all their
lives, and that their unhappiness had been because
their beloved playmate was not with them.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; Frederic added, &#8220;we have no toys
left, for I, like a stupid dolt, broke all our fine
things, and shied them into the thicket.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this the Stranger Child laughed merrily,
and cried: &#8220;Why, Fanchon and Frederic, you
are lying this minute among the loveliest playthings
that ever were seen!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&mdash;Where are they?&#8221; Fanchon and
Frederic both cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look around you,&#8221; said the Stranger Child.</p>

<p>Then Fanchon and Frederic saw how out of
the thick grass and moss all sorts of glorious
flowers were peeping, with bright eyes gleaming.
And between them many coloured stones and
crystal shells sparkled and shone. While little
golden insects danced up and down humming
gentle songs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now we will build a palace!&#8221; said the Stranger
Child. &#8220;Help me to get the stones together.&#8221;
And it stooped down and began to pick up
stones of many pretty colours.</p>

<p>Fanchon and Frederic helped, and the Stranger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
Child placed the beautiful stones one upon
another, and soon there rose tall pillars shining
in the sun, while an airy golden roof stretched
itself from pillar to pillar. Then the Stranger
Child kissed the flowers that were peeping from
the grass, and whispered to them lovingly, and
they shot up higher and higher, and, twining
together, formed sweet-scented arbours and covered
walks in which the children danced about,
full of delight and gladness.</p>

<p>The Stranger Child clapped its hands, and
immediately the golden roof, that was made of
insects&#8217; golden wings, fell to pieces with a hum,
and the pillars melted away into a splashing
silver stream, on whose banks flowers grew and
peeped into the water.</p>

<p>Then the Stranger Child plucked little blades
of grass and gathered twigs from trees, strewing
them on the ground before Fanchon and Frederic.
The blades of grass turned into the prettiest
little live dolls ever seen, and the twigs became
gay little huntsmen.</p>

<p>The dolls danced around Fanchon, and let her
take them in her lap, and they whispered in such
delicate little voices: &#8220;Be kind to us! Love us,
dear Fanchon.&#8221;</p>

<p>The huntsmen shouted: &#8220;Halloa! Halloa!
the hunt&#8217;s up!&#8221; and blew their horns, and bustled
about. Then tiny hares came darting out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
of the bushes, with tiny dogs after them, and the
huntsmen pursued them with shouts. This was
delightful!</p>

<p>Then suddenly these wonders disappeared.
And Fanchon and Frederic cried out: &#8220;What has
become of the dolls? Where are the huntsmen?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Stranger Child answered: &#8220;Oh, they are
always here waiting for you! They are close beside
you, so you may have them at any minute.
But just now would you not rather go with me
through the wood?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes! yes!&#8221; cried Fanchon and Frederic.</p>

<p>The Stranger Child took hold of their hands,
crying: &#8220;Come! Come!&#8221;</p>

<p>And with that off they went! The children
felt themselves floating along lightly and easily,
through the trees; while all the birds flew fluttering
beside them, singing and warbling their
sweetest songs. Then suddenly up they soared
into the air. Higher and higher they mounted
like birds, skimming above the tops of the trees.
Frederic shouted with delight, but Fanchon was
frightened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my breath is going! I shall tumble!&#8221;
she cried.</p>

<p>And just at that moment the Stranger Child
let them down gently to the ground, and said:
&#8220;Now I shall sound my Forest-Song. Then
good-bye for to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>And the Stranger Child took out a little horn
of wreathed gold, and began to sound it so
beautifully that the whole wood reëchoed wondrously
with its lovely music; while a host of
nightingales came flocking to the branches above
the children&#8217;s heads, and sang their most melodious
songs.</p>

<p>But all at once the music grew fainter and
fainter, and only a soft whispering seemed to
come from the thicket into which the Stranger
Child had vanished.</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow! To-morrow! I will come again!&#8221;
the children heard breathed gently as if from a
distance. Then they sighed with joy, for, though
they could not understand it, never had they
known such happiness in all their lives.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I wish it was to-morrow, now!&#8221; they
both cried, as they hastened home to their parents.</p>


<h5>HOW THE FOREST TALKED TO FANCHON
AND FREDERIC</h5>

<p>&#8220;I should fancy that the children had dreamed
all this,&#8221; said the Count to his wife, when Fanchon
and Frederic, who could think of nothing
else but the Stranger Child, and the wonderful
events, and the exquisite music, had told all that
had happened. &#8220;I should fancy that they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
dreamed all this, if they had not both seen the
same things! I cannot get to the bottom of it
all!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bother your head about it, my dear,&#8221;
answered his wife. &#8220;I think this Stranger Child
was nobody but the schoolmaster&#8217;s son from the
village. We must take care that he is not allowed
to put any more such nonsense into the
children&#8217;s heads.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the Count could not agree with her, for
he called the children to him again, to tell how
the Stranger Child was dressed and looked.
Fanchon and Frederic both agreed that its face
was fair as lilies, that it had cheeks like roses,
cherry lips, bright blue eyes, and locks of gold;
and that it was more beautiful than words could
tell.</p>

<p>But what they said about its dress sounded
absurd. For Fanchon said that its dress was
wondrous beautiful, shining and gleaming, as if
made of the petals of flowers; while Frederic
insisted that its garments were of sparkling
golden-green, like spring-leaves in the sunshine.</p>

<p>And Frederic thought that the Stranger Child
was a boy; while Fanchon was sure that it was
a girl. And these contradictions confused their
parents; and the Count shook his head wonderingly.</p>

<p>The next day, Fanchon and Frederic hastened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
to the wood, and found the Stranger Child waiting
for them. If their play had been glorious the
day before, it was ten times more glorious to-day;
for the Stranger Child did such marvellous
things that Fanchon and Frederic shouted for
joy.</p>

<p>While they played, the Stranger Child talked
sweetly to the trees, flowers, and birds, and to
the brook that ran through the wood; and they
all answered so clearly that Fanchon and Frederic
understood everything they said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear children!&#8221; cried the Alder-thicket,
&#8220;why were you not here early, when my friend
the Morning Breeze came rustling over the blue
hills, and brought us thousands of greetings and
kisses from the Golden Queen of the Dawn, and
plenty of wing-waftings full of sweet perfumes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh silence!&#8221; the flowers broke in. &#8220;Do not
mention that robber, the Morning Breeze! Does
he not steal our perfumes! Never mind the
Alders, children, let them lisp and whisper. Listen
to us! We love you so! We dress ourselves in
the loveliest colours just for you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And do we not love <i>you</i>, you beautiful flowers!&#8221;
said the Stranger Child tenderly.</p>

<p>But Fanchon knelt down on the grass, and
stretched out her arms, as if she would take all
the bright flowers to her heart, and cried: &#8220;Ah!
I love you! I love you every one!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>Then came a sighing out of the tall dark firtrees,
and they said: &#8220;We shade the flowers from the
hot sun, and shelter human children when the
storm comes rushing through the woods, but
who loves us in return?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Groan and sigh,&#8221; cried Frederic, &#8220;and murmur
as much as you like, you green giants that
you are! It is then that the real woodsman&#8217;s
heart rejoices in you! I love all, the green bushes,
the flowers, and you trees!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are quite right!&#8221; splashed the brook as
it sparkled over its stones. &#8220;Come sit down
among this moss, dear children, and listen to me.
I come from afar; out of a deep, cool, dark rock
I gush. Look into my waves, and I will show
you the loveliest pictures in my clear mirror,
the blue of the sky, the fleecy clouds, bushes,
trees, and blossoms; and your very selves, dear
children, I draw tenderly into my transparent
bosom!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fanchon and Frederic,&#8221; said the Stranger
Child, looking around with wondrous blissfulness.
&#8220;Only listen how they all love us! But the
redness of evening is rising behind the hills, and
the nightingale is calling me home!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but first let us fly a little, as we did yesterday!&#8221;
begged Frederic.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Fanchon, &#8220;but not quite so high.
It makes my head giddy.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>Then the Stranger Child took them each by
the hand again, and they went soaring up into
the golden purple of the evening sky, while the
birds crowded and sang around them.</p>

<p>Among the shining clouds, Frederic saw, as if
in wavering flame, beautiful castles all of rubies
and other precious stones.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look! Look! Fanchon!&#8221; he cried, full of rapture.
&#8220;Look at those splendid palaces! Let us
fly along as fast as we can, and we shall soon get
to them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fanchon, too, saw the castles, and forgot her
fear, and kept looking upward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those are my beloved castles-in-the-air,&#8221;
the Stranger Child said. &#8220;But we must go no
farther to-day!&#8221;</p>

<p>Fanchon and Frederic seemed to be in a dream,
and could not make out how they suddenly came
to find themselves with their father and mother.</p>


<h5>THE PALACE OF THE FAIRY QUEEN</h5>

<p>It was the next day. In the most beautiful
part of the wood beside the brook, between whispering
bushes, the Stranger Child had set up a
glorious tent made of tall slender lilies, glowing
roses, and tulips of every hue. And beneath this
tent, Fanchon and Frederic were seated with the
Stranger Child, listening to the forest brook as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
it whirled, and rippled, and sang its wonderful
stories.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell us,&#8221; said Fanchon, &#8220;darling Shining
Child, where your home is, and all about your
father and mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Stranger Child looked sorrowfully at the
sky. &#8220;Ah, my dear,&#8221; it said with a sigh, &#8220;is it
not enough that I come to you each day? Why
must you then ask about my home? Though you
were to travel day after day, forever and ever,
even to beyond the utmost range of the purple
hills, you could not reach it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah me!&#8221; sighed Fanchon. &#8220;Then you must
live hundreds and hundreds of miles away from
us! Is it only on a visit that you are here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fanchon, beloved,&#8221; said the Stranger Child,
&#8220;whenever you long for me with all your heart,
I am with you immediately, bringing you all
those plays and wonders. Is that not as good as
being in my home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; said Frederic, &#8220;for I believe
that you live in a most glorious place. I do not
care how hard the road is to your home, I mean
to set out this minute for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so you shall!&#8221; said the Stranger Child
smiling; &#8220;for when you see all this so clearly before
you, and make up your mind to be there, it
is as good as done! The land where I live, in
truth, is so beautiful and glorious that I can give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
you no description of it. It is my mother who
reigns over that land,&mdash;all glory and loveliness&mdash;as
Queen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! you are a Prince!&#8221; cried Frederic.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! you are a Princess!&#8221; cried Fanchon.</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly am,&#8221; said the Stranger Child.
&#8220;My mother&#8217;s palace is far more beautiful than
those glittering castles you saw in the evening
clouds. For the gleaming pillars of her palace
are of the purest crystal, and they soar slender
and tall into the blue of heaven. Upon them rests
a great, wide blue canopy. Beneath the canopy
sail the shining white clouds, hither and thither
on golden wings. And the red of the evening and
the morning rises and falls, and the sparkling
stars dance in a singing circle around her palace.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have heard of the Fairies who can bring
about great wonders. My mother is Queen of
the Fairies. Very often she holds a feast for little
children. It is then that the Elves, belonging to
my mother&#8217;s Kingdom, fly through the air weaving
shining rainbows from one end of her palace
to the other. Under these rainbows they build
my mother&#8217;s diamond throne,&mdash;that in appearance
and perfume is like lilies, roses, and carnations.</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother takes her place upon the throne,
and the Elves sing, and play on golden harps.
As soon as their music begins, everything in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
palace and in the woods and gardens, moves and
sings. And all around there are thousands of
beautiful little children in charming dresses,
shouting with delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;The children chase each other among the
golden trees, and throw blossoms at each other.
They climb the trees where the wind swings and
rocks them. They gather gold-glittering fruit,
and they play with tame deer and other gentle
wild creatures, that come bounding up to them
and lick their hands. Then the children run up
and down the rainbows; or they ride on the backs
of great Purple Birds that fly up among the gleaming
clouds.</p>

<p>&#8220;How delightful that must be!&#8221; cried Fanchon
and Frederic, with rapture. &#8220;Oh! take us
with you to your home, beautiful Shining Child!
We want to stay there always!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That may not be,&#8221; said the Stranger Child.</p>

<p>And Fanchon and Frederic cast down their
eyes sadly to the ground.</p>


<h5>THE WICKED MOUCHE</h5>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said the Stranger Child, &#8220;you might
not be so happy at my mother&#8217;s Court. Indeed,
it would be a great misfortune for you to try
to go to her Kingdom. There are many children
who cannot bear the singing of the Purple Birds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
and, if they hear their songs, they die. Then
too, destruction might overtake you before you
could reach my mother&#8217;s Court. Even I am not
safe on my way thither.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was a time when I was safe anywhere.
But now a bitter enemy of my mother, whom she
banished from her Kingdom, goes raging about
the world; and I cannot be safe from being
watched, pursued, and molested. Powerless as this
bitter enemy is when I am at home, nothing can
protect me from him, when I am flying abroad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What sort of a hateful creature is it,&#8221; asked
Fanchon, &#8220;that can do you so much harm?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have told you,&#8221; said the Stranger Child,
&#8220;that my mother is the Fairy Queen. Among
her many Elves are some who hover in the sky,
or dwell in the waters, and others who serve at
the Fairy Court. Once, a long while ago, there
came among those that served at Court, a stranger
who called himself Papillon. He said that he
was learned in all the sciences of the world, and
could accomplish great things among us. My
mother made him prime minister.</p>

<p>&#8220;Papillon soon showed his natural spite and
wickedness. He pretended to the Queen that he
loved children and could make them very happy.
But instead of doing so, he hung himself like a
weight of lead on the tails of the Purple Birds,
so that they could not fly aloft. And when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
children climbed the rose-trees, he dragged them
down by the legs. Then he knocked their noses
on the ground, and made them bleed. When
the children sang, he crammed all sorts of nasty
stuff down their throats; for sweet and happy
singing he could not abide. And worst of all, he
had a way of smearing the sparkling precious
stones of the palace, and the lilies and roses, and
even the shining rainbows, with a horrible black
juice, so that everything beautiful became sorrowful
or dead.</p>

<p>&#8220;And when he had done all this, he gave a
loud hissing laugh, and said that everything
was now as he wished it to be. Then, shouting
that he was greater than my mother, he went
flying up into the air, in the shape of an enormous
fly with flashing eyes, and a long snout. After
which he went humming and buzzing around my
mother&#8217;s throne, in a most abominable fashion.</p>

<p>&#8220;When the Queen my mother and her Elves
saw this, they knew that he had come among
them under a false name, and that he was none
other than Mouche, the gloomy King of the
Gnomes. The entire Fairy Court thereupon
rushed against him beating him with their wings,
while the Purple Birds seized him with their
glittering beaks and gripped him so tightly that
he screamed with agony and rage. After which
the birds shook him violently, and threw him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
down to the earth. He fell straight onto the
back of his old Aunt, who was a great blue toad.
And she carried him off to her hole.</p>

<p>&#8220;But five hundred of the children in the Fairy
Court armed themselves with fly-flappers, to
defend themselves against Mouche if he should
ever venture to return. Now after he was gone,
all the black juice disappeared, and everything
became as shining and glorious as before.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you see, dear Children,&#8221; continued the
Stranger Child, &#8220;what kind of a creature I have
to fear. This horrible Mouche follows me about,
and, if I did not hide myself quickly, he would
injure me. And I assure you that if I were to
take you with me to my home, Mouche would
lie in wait for us, and kill us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fanchon wept bitterly at the danger to which
the Stranger Child was exposed. But Frederic
said: &#8220;If that horrible Mouche is nothing but a
great fly, I&#8217;ll soon hit him with father&#8217;s big fly-flapper!
And if once I give him a good crack on
his nose, Aunty Blue Toad will have a job carrying
him to her hole again!&#8221;</p>


<h5>HOW TUTOR INK ARRIVED TO TEACH THE
CHILDREN</h5>

<p>Fanchon and Frederic ran home as fast as
they could, shouting as they went:&mdash;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>&#8220;Oh! the Shining Child is a beautiful Princess!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! the Shining Child is a beautiful Prince!&#8221;</p>

<p>They wanted, in their delight, to tell this to
their parents, but their father came to meet
them with a most extraordinary man walking
by his side. This stranger kept muttering to
himself:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a nice pair of stupids these are! Ah!
Ah!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Count took him by the hand, and said to
the children: &#8220;This gentleman is the tutor whom
your kind Cousin has sent to teach you. So now
shake hands with him, and bid him welcome.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the children looked sidewise at him, and
could move neither hand nor foot. This was because
they had never seen such an extraordinary
being. He was no taller than Frederic. His body
was round and bloated, and his little weazen
legs could hardly support its weight. His head
was queer and square, and his face too ugly for
anything, for not only was his nose long and
pointed, but his little bulging eyes glittered, and
his wide mouth was opened in a ferocious way.
He was clad in black from top to toe, and his
name was Tutor Ink.</p>

<p>Now, as the children stood staring like stone
images, their mother cried out angrily: &#8220;You
rude children, what are you thinking of? Come!
come! give the tutor your hands.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>The children, taking heart, did as their mother
bade them. But as soon as Tutor Ink took hold
of their hands, they jumped back, screaming:
&#8220;Oh! Oh! It hurts!&#8221;</p>

<p>The tutor laughed aloud, and showed a needle,
which he had hidden in his hand to prick the
children with. Fanchon was weeping; but Frederic
growled. &#8220;Just try that again, little Big-Body,
if you dare!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you do that, Tutor Ink?&#8221; asked the
Count, somewhat annoyed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s just my way!&#8221; answered Tutor
Ink; &#8220;I can&#8217;t alter it!&#8221; and with that he stuck
his hands to his sides, and went on laughing until
his voice sounded like the noise of a broken
rattle.</p>

<p>Alas! after that there was no more running
about in the wood! Instead the children, day
after day, had to sit in the house, repeating after
Tutor Ink strange gibberish, not one word of
which they could understand.</p>

<p>With what longing eyes they looked at the
wood! Often they thought they heard, amidst
the happy songs of the birds and the rustling
of the trees, the voice of the Stranger Child,
calling, and calling: &#8220;Fanchon! Frederic! Are
you not coming to play with me? Oh, come! I
have made you a palace all of flowers! We will
play there, and I will give you all sorts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
beautiful stones! And then we&#8217;ll fly through
the air, and build cloud-castles! Come! Oh,
come!&#8221;</p>

<p>At this the children&#8217;s thoughts were so drawn
to the wood, that they neither heard nor saw
their tutor any longer; although he thumped on
the table with both his fists, and hummed, and
growled, and snarled.</p>

<p>At last one day the Count perceived how pale
the children were getting, and bade Tutor Ink
take them for a walk. The Tutor did not like
the idea at all. And the children did not like it
either, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;What business has Tutor Ink in our darling
wood?&#8221;</p>


<h5>WHAT HAPPENED WHEN TUTOR INK TOOK
THE CHILDREN TO THE WOOD</h5>

<p>&#8220;Well, Tutor Ink, is it not delightful here in
our wood?&#8221; asked Frederic.</p>

<p>Tutor Ink made a face, and muttered: &#8220;Stupid
nonsense! All one does is to tear his stockings!
One can&#8217;t hear a word because of the
abominable screeching of the birds!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But surely you love the flowers?&#8221; Fanchon
chimed in.</p>

<p>At this Tutor Ink&#8217;s face became a deep cherry-colour,
and he beat his hands about him, crying:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
&#8220;Stupid nonsense! Ridiculous nonsense! There
are no decent flowers in this wood!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t you see those dear little Lilies-of-the-valley
peeping up at you with such bright
loving eyes?&#8221; asked Fanchon.</p>

<p>&#8220;What! What!&#8221; the Tutor screamed. &#8220;Flowers!&mdash;eyes?&mdash;Ha!
Ha!&mdash;Nice eyes!&mdash;Useless
things!&#8221; And with that he stooped, and plucking
up a handful of the lilies, roots and all, threw
them into the thicket.</p>

<p>Fanchon could not help shedding bitter tears,
and Frederic gnashed his teeth in anger. Just
then a little Robin alighted on a branch near
the Tutor&#8217;s head, and began to sing sweetly.
The Tutor, picking up a stone, threw it, and the
bird fell dying to the ground.</p>

<p>Frederic could restrain himself no longer.
&#8220;You horrible Tutor Ink!&#8221; he cried, &#8220;what did
the little bird do to you, that you should strike
it dead?&#8221; And looking toward the thicket, he
called sadly: &#8220;Oh! where are you, beautiful Shining
Child? Oh, come! Only come! Let us fly
far, far away! I cannot stay beside this horrible
creature any longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Fanchon, stretching out her hands,
sobbed and wept bitterly. &#8220;Oh, you darling
Shining Child,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Come to us! Come
to us! Save us! Save us! Tutor Ink is killing
us, as he is killing the flowers and birds!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>&#8220;What do you mean by the Shining Child?&#8221;
snarled Tutor Ink.</p>

<p>But at that instant there was a loud whispering,
and a rustling, in the thicket, and a sound
as of muffled drums tolling in the distance. Then
the children saw, in a shining cloud that floated
above them, the beautiful face of the Stranger
Child, and tears like glittering pearls were rolling
down its rosy cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! darling playmates!&#8221; it cried. &#8220;I cannot
come to you any more! Farewell! Farewell!
The Gnome Mouche has you in his power! Oh!
you poor children, good-bye! good-bye!&#8221;</p>

<p>And then the Stranger Child soared up far
into the clouds. And the most marvellous thing
happened! Behind the children there began a
most horrid, fearsome buzzing and humming,
snarling and growling, and, lo! Tutor Ink had
changed into an enormous frightful-looking fly.
And he began to fly upward heavily, following
the Stranger Child.</p>

<p>Fanchon and Frederic, overpowered with
terror, ran out of the wood, and did not dare to
look up at the sky until they had got some distance
away. And, then, when they did so, all
that they could see, was a shining speck in the
clouds, glittering like a star, and coming nearer
and downward.</p>

<p>The star grew bigger and bigger, and the children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
could hear, as if it were, the call of a trumpet;
and presently they saw that the star was
really a splendid bird with shining purple plumage.
It came dropping down to the wood, clapping
its mighty wings, and singing loud and
clear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah! Hurrah!&#8221; shouted Frederic. &#8220;That
is a Purple Bird from the Fairy Court! He will
bite Tutor Ink to death! The Shining Child is
saved!&mdash;and so are we! Come, Fanchon, let us
get home as fast as we can, and tell our father
about it.&#8221;</p>


<h5>WHAT THE COUNT DID TO TUTOR INK</h5>

<p>The children burst into the house where their
parents were sitting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah! Hurrah!&#8221; Frederic shouted. &#8220;The
Purple Bird has bitten Tutor Ink to death!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Father dear, Mother dear!&#8221; cried Fanchon.
&#8220;Tutor Ink is not Tutor Ink at all! He is
really the wicked Mouche, King of the Gnomes;
a monstrous fly, but a fly with clothes and shoes
and stockings on!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who on earth has been putting such nonsense
into your heads?&#8221; asked the Countess.</p>

<p>And the parents gazed at the children in utter
amazement, while they went oh to tell about the
Stranger Child whose mother was a great Fairy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
Queen, and about the Gnome King, Mouche, and
the Purple Bird.</p>

<p>The Count grew very grave and thoughtful.
&#8220;Frederic,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you are really a sensible
boy, and I must admit that Tutor Ink has always
seemed to me a strange mysterious creature.
Your mother and I are by no means satisfied
with him, particularly your mother. He
has such a terrible sweet-tooth, that there&#8217;s no
way of keeping him from the sugar and jams.
And, then, he hums and buzzes in such a distressing
manner. But in spite of all this, my dear
boy, just think calmly for a minute. Even if
there are such things as Gnomes in the world,
do you really mean to say that your Tutor has
become a fly?&#8221;</p>

<p>Frederic looked his father steadily in the face
with his clear blue eyes, then said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should not have believed it myself, if the
Stranger Child had not said so, and if I had not
seen with my own eyes that he is only a horrible
fly, and pretends to be Tutor Ink. And then,&#8221;
continued Frederic, while his father shook his
head in wonder, &#8220;see what Mother says about
him. Is he not ravenous for sweet things? Is
that not just like a fly? And then his hummings
and buzzings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence,&#8221; cried the Count. &#8220;Whatever Tutor
Ink is, one thing is certain, the Purple Bird has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
not bitten him to death! for there he comes out
of the wood!&#8221;</p>

<p>At this the children uttered loud screams, and
rushed behind the door. In truth, Tutor Ink was
approaching, but he was wild-looking and bewildered.
He was buzzing and humming, and springing
high in the air, first to one side, then to the
other, and banging his head against the trees. He
tumbled into the house, and dashed at the milk-jug,
and popped his head into it so that the milk
ran over the sides. Then he gulped and gulped,
making a horrid noise of swallowing.</p>

<p>&#8220;What ails you, Tutor Ink?&#8221; cried the Countess.
&#8220;What are you about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you out of your senses?&#8221; asked the Count.
&#8220;Is the foul fiend after you?&#8221;</p>

<p>But without making any answer, Tutor Ink,
taking his mouth from the milk-jug, threw himself
down on the dish of butter, and began to
lick it with his pointed tongue. Then, with a
loud buzzing, he sprang off the table and began
to stagger hither and thither about the room, as
though he was drunk.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is pretty behaviour!&#8221; cried the Count, as
he tried to seize Tutor Ink by the coat tails; but
Tutor Ink managed to elude him deftly.</p>

<p>Just then Frederic came running up with his
father&#8217;s big fly-flapper in his hand, and gave it
to the Count, crying:&mdash;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>&#8220;Here you are, Father! Knock the terrible
Mouche to death!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Count took the fly-flapper; and then they
all set to work to drive away Tutor Ink. Fanchon
and Frederic and their mother took table
napkins, and made sweeps with them in the air,
driving the Tutor backward and forward, here
and there, while the Count kept striking at him
with the fly-flapper.</p>

<p>Wilder and wilder grew the chase. &#8220;<i>Hum!
Hum!</i>&#8221; and &#8220;<i>Sum! Sum!</i>&#8221; went the Tutor, storming
hither and thither. &#8220;<i>Flip! Flap!</i>&#8221; and &#8220;<i>Clip!
Clap!</i>&#8221; went the table napkins and fly-flapper.</p>

<p>At last the Count managed to hit the Tutor&#8217;s
coat tails. Then just as the Count was going to
strike a second time, up bounced the Tutor into
the air, and, with renewed strength, stormed, humming
and buzzing, out of the door, and away
among the trees.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well done!&#8221; exclaimed the Count. &#8220;We are
rid of that abominable Tutor Ink! Never shall
he cross my threshold again!&#8221;</p>


<h5>HOW THE NAUGHTY PLAYTHINGS BECAME
ALIVE</h5>

<p>Fanchon and Frederic now breathed freely once
more. A great weight was taken off their hearts.
They rejoiced that now, since the wicked Mouche<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
was gone, the Stranger Child might come back.
They hurried to the wood. Everything was
silent and deserted. Not a merry note of a single
bird was there. Instead of the joyous singing of
the brook, and the gladsome rustling of the leaves,
they seemed to hear sighs and moans that passed
through the air. Just then, close behind them,
snarling voices cried out:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stupid creatures! Senseless creatures! You
despised us! You did not know how to treat us!
We are come back to punish you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Fanchon and Frederic looked around, and saw
the little hunter and the harper rise out of the
thicket. The harper twanged his tiny harp, while
the hunter took aim at Frederic; and both cried
out:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait, you boy and girl! We are obedient
servants of Tutor Ink! He will be here in a moment,
and then we&#8217;ll pay you well for despising us!&#8221;</p>

<p>Terrified, the children turned to run away,
when the doll rose up out of the thicket, and
squeaked out:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stupid creatures! Senseless creatures! I am
an obedient servant of Tutor Ink! He will be
here in a moment, and then I&#8217;ll pay you well
for despising me!&#8221; And with that the naughty
creature sent great splashes of muddy water flying
at Fanchon and Frederic, so that they were
quite wet.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>Then the children fell on their knees sobbing:
&#8220;Oh, how unfortunate we are! Will no one take
pity on us!&#8221;</p>

<p>Scarcely had they said thus, when the playthings
disappeared. The rushing of the brook
turned to the sweetest music. All the wood
streamed with a wonderful sparkling light. And,
lo! the Stranger Child came forth from the
thicket, surrounded by such brilliant rays that
Fanchon and Frederic had to shut their eyes for
a minute.</p>

<p>Then they felt themselves touched gently,
and the Stranger Child&#8217;s sweet voice said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, do not mourn for me, dear playmates!
Though you will not see me again, still I shall be
near you. Neither the wicked Mouche nor any
other Gnome shall have power to harm you. Only
go on loving me faithfully.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That we shall! that we shall! dear Shining
Child!&#8221; the children cried. &#8220;We love you with
all our hearts!&#8221;</p>

<p>And at last when they could open their eyes,
the Stranger Child had vanished; and all their
grief and fear were gone, too. Delight beamed in
their eyes and shone in their cheeks.</p>

<p>And what the Stranger Child had said, came
to pass. Nothing ever harmed Fanchon and
Frederic. They grew up handsome, clever, and
sweet-tempered; and all that they undertook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
prospered. And as the years went on, they still,
in their dreams, played with the Stranger Child,
who never ceased to bring them the loveliest
things from its Fairy Home.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
